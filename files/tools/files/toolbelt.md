# The MIT Toolbelt

**Five Tools, One Flow: Structure to Prediction**

Work left to right. No backflow. If something fails at Tool 3, you do not "fix" it at Tool 5.

This is the machinery, not the results. For the scored predictions it produces, see the Score sections of the [framework](../../framework/README.md), [cosmos](../../cosmos/), and [spectrum](../../spectrum/) pages and the [mass spectrum](../../spectrum/files/mass-spectrum.md).

## Tool 1: Geometry / Topology (The Frame)

**Role:** Defines what is allowed to exist. Computes nothing. Constrains everything.

| Element | Statement | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Postulate | S¹ = boundary(Möbius) embeds in S³, boundary(S³) = empty | AXIOM |
| Anti-periodic BC | ψ(y + L) = -ψ(y) | AXIOM |
| Non-orientable topology | Möbius strip is the 2-manifold | AXIOM |
| Cosmic wave | Ψ(t) = cos(t/2), period 4π, standing wave, t = 0 is real | AXIOM |
| Hierarchy | S³ (venue, n=3) contains Möbius (surface, n=2) whose boundary is S¹ (edge, n=1) | DERIVED |
| Uniqueness | Poincaré conjecture + classification theorems fix all three manifolds | DERIVED |
| 120 structure | 2I (binary icosahedral, largest exceptional discrete subgroup of SU(2) ≅ S³) acts freely; \|2I\| = 120 | DERIVED |
| Gauss-Codazzi | 3/2 curvature interface: R_spatial = 3R_Σ = 2Λ → Λ_obs = (3/2)Λ_top. First positive eigenvalue λ₁ = 2/R² = R_Σ. | DERIVED |
| Topological protection of Λ | Λ_top sits at the antinode (Θ = 60/120) where d ln C/dΘ = 0; no perturbation can shift it. | DERIVED |
| G as exchange rate | Topology sources both the curvature (Λ_obs = 3/R²) and the energy floor (μ_Λ). G is the exchange rate: G = 3c⁴/(8πR²μ_Λ⁴), with all G-dependence collecting into m ∝ G^{-(15+d)/60}: closed-form given c, ℏ, R, and one measured mass. | ESTABLISHED |

**What this tool settles:**

The 120-grid IS S³ structure, not a filter applied to it. S¹ is partitioned into 120 arcs of π/60 each. The chronon is π/30 = 4π/120; the minimum action ΔS_min = ℏπ/30 is absolute (a Lorentz scalar, holds in every frame).

### Division of Labor

| Structure | What it determines | Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Möbius surface (2D) | Vacuum energy Λ | First positive eigenvalue, Gauss-Codazzi |
| Binary icosahedral group 2I | Particle spectrum, mass gap, generations | McKay decomposition, Reidemeister torsion |
| Stabilizer triple (2, 3, 5) | Color, domain, forces, gravity ratio | Face/edge/vertex decompositions and interfaces |
| Observer at √Ω | Coupling constants, hierarchy | Scaling law at Fibonacci wells |
| S³ space | Spatial curvature | Responds to all of the above |
| G | Curvature-energy exchange rate | 3c⁴/(8πR²μ_Λ⁴); closed-form from topology + one mass anchor |

Gravity sits outside the gauge ladder as the interface between continuous S³ geometry and the discrete 120 domain; why it resists quantization is worked in [The Waltz](../../spectrum/files/the-waltz.md) §III.

**If something violates Tool 1, it is not part of MIT. Full stop.**

---

## Tool 2: Representation Theory (The Skeleton)

**Role:** Defines what can move inside the frame. No dynamics. Allowed degrees of freedom only.

### McKay Graph (SPECTRUM Convention)

```
R0(1) --- R1(2) --- R3(3) --- R6(4) --- R7(5) --- R8(6) --- R5(4) --- R2(2)
                                                       |
                                                      R4(3)

(R4 branches from R8; dist(R4) = dist(R8) + 1 = 6)
```

### Master Table

| Irrep | dim | Spin | Graph Dist | j_first | Kostant exponents | E₈ exponents? |
|-------|-----|------|------------|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| R0 | 1 | Int | 0 | 0 | {0, 30} | No |
| R1 | 2 | Half | 1 | 1/2 | {1, 11, 19, 29} | All 4 |
| R2 | 2 | Half | 7 | 7/2 | {7, 13, 17, 23} | All 4 |
| R3 | 3 | Int | 2 | 1 | {2, 10, 12, 18, 20, 28} | No |
| R4 | 3 | Int | 6 | 3 | {6, 10, 14, 16, 20, 24} | No |
| R5 | 4 | Int | 6 | 3 | {6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24} | No |
| R6 | 4 | Half | 3 | 3/2 | {3, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 27} | 4 of 8 |
| R7 | 5 | Int | 4 | 2 | {4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26} | No |
| R8 | 6 | Half | 5 | 5/2 | {5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15x2, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25} | 6 of 12 |

### Structural Rules

| Rule | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| j_first rule | j_first = (graph distance from R0) / 2; holds for both spin parities |
| E₈ exponents | {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} live ONLY on half-integer irreps |
| Kostant polynomial | 2 × dim terms per irrep; mean exponent = 15 = h/2 |
| Kostant sum rule | Sum of C(e/60) over Kostant exponents = 2 × dim (every irrep) |
| Galois conjugation | Swaps R1 ↔ R2, R3 ↔ R4; fixes R5, R7 |
| Shell closure | Cumulative dimension reaches 30 = h(E₈) at the shell |

Masslessness as a topological address (edge-only propagation costs no mass; photons and gluons stay on S¹, W/Z/fermions cross to the surface) is in [The Waltz](../../spectrum/files/the-waltz.md) §V.

### C_geom Values

Geometric mean of C(e/D) = 2sin²(πe/D) over Kostant exponents. Domain D = 60 for integer-spin, D = 120 for half-integer (the edge stabilizer Z₄ ⊂ 2I: integer-spin carries real Z₄ content, half-integer carries complex pairs, the spin-statistics connection built into the group).

| Irrep | Spin | D | C_geom |
|-------|------|---|--------|
| R1 | Half | 120 | 0.0988 |
| R2 | Half | 120 | 0.2436 |
| R3 | Int | 60 | 0.5553 |
| R4 | Int | 60 | 0.7970 |
| R5 | Int | 60 | 0.8017 |
| R6 | Half | 120 | 0.2098 |
| R7 | Int | 60 | 0.7564 |
| R8 | Half | 120 | 0.2382 |

### Icosahedral Stabilizer Structure

The binary icosahedral group 2I inherits three stabilizer subgroups from the icosahedron. Each encodes a layer of physical structure.

| Stabilizer | Subgroup | Physical content | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Face (Z₃) | Order 3 | Color: singlet vs triplet | LOCKED |
| Edge (Z₄) | Order 4 | Domain: D = 60 vs 120; spin-statistics | LOCKED |
| Vertex (Z₅) | Order 5 | Electroweak interface; T₃ via Coxeter-Galois gate | ESTABLISHED |
| Face/Edge ratio | 3/2 | Gravity: Gauss-Codazzi conversion (derived); the Face/Edge identification is conjectural | MOTIVATED |
| Vertex through twist | cos(π/10) | Weak coupling correction; parity violation | MOTIVATED |

- **Color (faces, Z₃):** restricting an irrep to Z₃ splits it into color singlets (leptons) and triplets (quarks); generation-independent (the face geometry is vacuum-invariant).
- **Domain (edges, Z₄):** the D = 60 / 120 split is forced by Z₄ ⊂ 2I and encodes spin-statistics; C_geom evaluates Kostant exponents on the correct grid per irrep.
- **Electroweak (vertex, Z₅):** R1 and R2 are Galois conjugates differing in Z₅ content. The T₃ assignment is the two-stage Coxeter-Galois gate (j_first parity + (13,17) stripping + Galois content), verified at 10/10 SM entries; hypercharge Y follows via Gell-Mann-Nishijima.

The three stabilizer orders 2, 3, 5 are the primes dividing |2I| = 120.

---

## Tool 3: Spectral Arithmetic (The Fingerprint)

**Role:** Assigns a number to each irrep. You read torsion values out of this tool; you do not re-derive them.

### Convention Note

The RH program (Common_Threads) labels only the 5 integer-spin irreps R0, R2, R4, R6, R8. This toolbelt uses SPECTRUM convention (R0-R8 for all 9). Translation:

| Common_Threads | SPECTRUM | dim | Spin |
|----------------|----------|-----|------|
| R0 | R0 | 1 | Int |
| R2 (3a) | R3 | 3 | Int |
| R4 | R7 | 5 | Int |
| R6 | R5 | 4 | Int |
| R8 (3b) | R4 | 3 | Int |

### Torsion Values (Integer-Spin, Trivial Vacuum, Closed Form)

| Irrep | dim | T² | log T² |
|-------|-----|-----|---------|
| R0 | 1 | π⁴/3600 | -3.60977 |
| R3 | 3 | (4/5) φ⁻² | -1.18557 |
| R7 | 5 | 9/4 | +0.81093 |
| R5 | 4 | 25/9 | +1.02165 |
| R4 | 3 | (4/5) φ² | +0.73928 |

The Galois pair is the key relation: **T²(R3) / T²(R4) = φ⁻⁴** (exact), i.e. log T²(R3) − log T²(R4) = −4 log φ. The golden ratio enters through the scalar sector and the Legendre symbol mod 5, the character field Q(√5) of 2I.

### 24 Vacuum Torsion Values

From log T²(ρ⊗σ) = Σ_τ N_ρστ log T²(τ):

| ρ | T²(ρ, triv) | T²(ρ, std) | T²(ρ, gal) |
|---|-------------|------------|------------|
| R1 | 15.887 | 0.00827 | 2.778 |
| R2 | 0.473 | 2.778 | 0.0567 |
| R3 | 0.306 | 68.765 | 0.257 |
| R4 | 2.094 | 0.257 | 2.048 |
| R5 | 2.778 | 0.122 | 4.089 |
| R6 | 4.328 | 0.688 | 4.712 |
| R7 | 2.250 | 1.114 | 1.114 |
| R8 | 0.257 | 13.090 | 1.910 |

R7 is the only irrep where T²(std) = T²(gal): the electron sits where the Galois distinction vanishes. These 24 values are the torsion factor T²(ρ⊗σ) you feed into the mass formula.

**Dead-end gate (Lemma 8):** no natural map exists between the phase position Θ and the spectral parameter s on S³/2I, so the mass formula's fine structure cannot be completed by extending spectral arithmetic. This is proved, not open: do not pursue that route. The L-basis decomposition, the spin-parity split, and the curvature duality behind these values are in [The Mirror](../../spectrum/files/the-mirror.md).

---

## Tool 4: Vacuum Structure (The Selector)

**Role:** Chooses which copy of the fingerprint is active. Does not change the fingerprint.

### Three Isolated Vacua

| Vacuum | Source | Isolation guarantee |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Trivial | Flat connection | H¹(M; ad ρ) = 0 |
| Standard | Irreducible connection | H¹(M; ad ρ) = 0 |
| Galois | Galois conjugate connection | H¹(M; ad ρ) = 0 |

### Mass Gaps (Yang-Mills)

| Vacuum | First allowed k | Gap |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| Trivial | k = 1 | 4/R² |
| Standard | k = 1 | 4/R² |
| Galois | k = 5 | 36/R² (9× enhancement) |
| Overall | | 4/R² |

The 9× enhancement at the Galois vacuum traces to R4's position at the extremal branch endpoint of the E₈ McKay graph (dist = 6, farthest from R0 along the side branch).

### Vacuum Spectra (j_first per irrep per vacuum)

| Irrep | j_first (trivial) | j_first (standard) | j_first (Galois) |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| R0 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| R1 | 1/2 | 1/2 | 5/2 |
| R2 | 7/2 | 5/2 | 3/2 |
| R3 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| R4 | 3 | 2 | 0 |
| R5 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| R6 | 3/2 | 1/2 | 3/2 |
| R7 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| R8 | 5/2 | 3/2 | 1/2 |

Caveat: the j_first ordering is not uniform across vacua, and the specific generation-to-vacuum mapping is open ([framework](../../framework/README.md), Three Generations). The T₃ quantum-number rule below is separate and is established.

### The Assignment Rules

- **Eta sign gate:** η(ρ,σ) > 0 ⟹ Q ≤ 0. All entries with Q = +2/3 (u, c, t) have η < 0; all η > 0 entries carry Q = 0 or −1/3. The eta invariant (spectral asymmetry) ties parity to electric charge.
- **Vacuum as electroweak selector:** the same irrep carries different fermions in different vacua (R8 → up in trivial, down in Galois, μ/s in standard). Mechanism: the trivial vacuum preserves the Coxeter pair (13, 17) under h(E₈) = 30 (→ Q = +2/3); the nontrivial vacua strip it (→ Q ≤ −1/3).
- **T₃ gate:** the two-stage Coxeter-Galois gate assigns weak isospin at each (ρ,σ) before mass is computed. Verified at 10/10 SM-assigned entries.

---

## Tool 5: Scaling Law / Mass Generator (The Output)

**Role:** Turns structure into numbers.

### The Scaling Law

```
A / A_P ≈ C(Θ) · (√Ω)⁻ⁿ
```

where C(Θ) = 2 sin²(πΘ). Worked example, one well: α sits at Θ = 13/60 on the bosonic grid, C(13/60) = 0.79, n = 1/30 on √Ω_Λ, giving A/A_P = 7.33 × 10⁻³. The other cosmological evaluations (a₀, H₀, Λ) are tabulated in the [framework engine](../../framework/README.md) and scored in the [cosmos pages](../../cosmos/).

### The Mass Formula

$$m(\rho, \sigma) = \mu_\Lambda \times C_{\text{geom}}(\rho) \times (\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda})^{\,\text{dist}(\rho)/30} \times T^2(\rho \otimes \sigma)$$

Four factors, four sources:

| Factor | Role | Value/Source |
|--------|------|-------------|
| μ_Λ | Vacuum energy floor; fourth root of the cosmological-constant energy density (Tool 1: first positive eigenvalue → Gauss-Codazzi → Λ_obs → ρ_Λ^(1/4)) | ρ_Λ^(1/4) ≈ 2.25 meV |
| C_geom(ρ) | Phase factor; geometric mean of C(e/D) over Kostant exponents (Tool 2) | D = 60 / 120 |
| (√Ω_Λ)^(dist/30) | Hierarchy; McKay graph distance sets orders of magnitude (Tool 2) | denominator h(E₈) = 30 |
| T²(ρ⊗σ) | Reidemeister torsion, vacuum-twisted; fine structure / generation mechanism (Tools 3-4) | 24 values, 8 irreps × 3 vacua |

**Checksums** (the formula's computed output across the McKay distances; verify an independent implementation against these, then read the scored comparison off mass-spectrum.md):

| ρ | dist | σ | m (GeV) | SM |
|---|------|----|---------|-----|
| R1 | 1 | std | 1.98 × 10⁻¹³ | ν₁ |
| R7 | 4 | triv | 5.21 × 10⁻⁴ | e |
| R8 | 5 | triv | 2.03 × 10⁻³ | u |
| R8 | 5 | std | 1.03 × 10⁻¹ | μ / s |
| R4 | 6 | std | 7.34 × 10⁻¹ | τ |
| R2 | 7 | std | 261.46 | t |

Applied to the 8 nontrivial irreps across 3 vacua, the formula produces 24 entries across the fermion band. The match against the measured fermions is a comparison, not a prediction: the topology fixes the count and the quantum-number content of each entry, while the mass match is softer (pending a null test). The full 24-entry comparison (ranks, ratios, the 7-of-9 / 6-of-8 charged-fermion tally, the dead zone, the ν₂ and charm gaps) lives in [the mass spectrum](../../spectrum/files/mass-spectrum.md) §III.

### Key Numbers

| Number | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| \|2I\| | 120 | Largest exceptional discrete subgroup of SU(2) |
| Period | 4π | Anti-periodic BC |
| Gauss-Codazzi | 3/2 | Surface to space conversion |
| Chronon | π/30 | 4π/120 |
| Bosonic step | 2/120 | Spinor to scalar projection |
| Active wells | {13, 21, 34, 55, 60}/120 | Hurwitz stability + threshold |
| H₀ shift | 8.4% | C(36/120)/C(34/120) = 1.084 (lattice arithmetic; the galactic trigger is withdrawn, SPARC) |
| Inputs | c, ℏ, R, m_e | R open (α / mass-spectrum routes; de Sitter circular); Ω_m = 1 − Ω_Λ ≈ 0.315 is a temporal-budget output |

Open derivations (the α exponent's single-principle form, the charm/assignment problem, the black-hole Φ → Θ dynamical mapping, the spectral-physical bridge) are tracked in the [working notes](../../framework/working/).

If something fails at step 3, you do not fix it at step 5. That is how you avoid numerology.
