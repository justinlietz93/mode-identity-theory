# The Scaling Law as Forced Measurement Postulate on S³/2I

**Status:** FUTURE WORK
**Priority:** Post-October 2026
**Dependencies:** Sector A paper (Λ eigenvalue), Lemma 8 (spectral boundary)

---

## The Question

Given S¹ = ∂(Möbius) ↪ S³, ∂S³ = ∅, with anti-periodic boundary conditions and the 120-domain native to S³, is there any measurement rule other than

$$\frac{A}{A_P} = C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$$

that produces finite, well-defined observables?

If not, the scaling law is forced by the topology. Not derived from it in the usual sense. Forced by it, the way Born's rule is forced by Hilbert space structure (Gleason's theorem).

**Note on calibration vs form.** The engine file writes the scaling law with $\approx$, reflecting that the kinematic identification of $\Omega$ with a physical quantity (e.g., $\Omega_H = (c/(H\ell_P))^2$ for edge modes) is approximate: the precise hierarchy normalization $N$ is fixed by calibrating through one measured observable per sector ($H$ for edge modes, $R$ for surface modes). The uniqueness question addressed here is about the *functional form* $C(\Theta) \times g(\Omega, n)$: whether the factored structure, the sinusoidal phase operator, and the power-law hierarchy are the only options compatible with the topology. The calibration step is a separate, already-resolved question about how the form connects to measurement.

## The Precedent: Gleason's Theorem

Gleason (1957) proved that on a Hilbert space of dimension ≥ 3, the only probability measure consistent with the lattice of projections is the Born rule: p = |⟨ψ|φ⟩|². The theorem doesn't derive Born from dynamics. It shows Born is the unique measure compatible with the structure.

The MIT analog: show that C(Θ) × (√Ω)⁻ⁿ is the unique sampling rule compatible with the bounded, closed topology of S¹ = ∂M ↪ S³, ∂S³ = ∅.

## The Constraints and What They Eliminate

| # | Constraint | Source | What it eliminates |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Anti-periodic BC: ψ(y+L) = -ψ(y) | Möbius non-orientability (AXIOM) | All non-sinusoidal phase operators. Ground mode is sin(πΘ), intensity is sin²(πΘ). No polynomial, exponential, or rational alternative survives the BC. |
| 2 | Bounded domain: ∂S³ = ∅ | Poincaré (THEOREM) | Any hierarchy that doesn't terminate. Ω is finite. The dilution must be a function of a finite ratio, not an asymptotic series. |
| 3 | Discrete 120-domain: \|2I\| = 120 | Largest exceptional discrete subgroup of SU(2) (THEOREM) | Continuous sampling rules. Phase positions are quantized to multiples of 1/120. |
| 4 | Observer at √Ω | IR↔UV fixed point on bounded domain (DERIVED) | Any other normalization point. The geometric midpoint is unique: x = Ω/x has one positive solution. |
| 5 | Dimensionless output | A/Aₚ is a ratio | Additive forms like C + Ω⁻ⁿ. Dimensionless ratios require multiplicative decomposition of dimensionless factors. |
| 6 | Factorization into position and depth | Phase and hierarchy are independent coordinates on the domain | Mixed forms like C(Θ, Ω). Phase position (where on the spectrum) and manifold depth (which layer) address different structural questions. Independence forces factorization. |

## The Argument Shape

**Step 1:** Establish the space of candidate measurement rules.

Any rule must be a map from (phase position Θ, manifold depth n, hierarchy Ω) to a dimensionless observable ratio. The output space is ℝ⁺. The input space is {Θ ∈ k/120} × {n ∈ ℤ or ℤ/2} × {Ω ∈ ℝ⁺, finite}.

**Step 2:** Apply constraint 5. Dimensionless output from dimensionless inputs requires a product of dimensionless functions:

$$\frac{A}{A_P} = f(\Theta) \cdot g(\Omega, n)$$

or some more complex multiplicative combination. Constraint 6 (independence of position and depth) forces the factored form.

**Step 3:** Apply constraint 1. f(Θ) must satisfy anti-periodic BC. The unique L² ground-state intensity on the Möbius strip is 2sin²(πΘ). Higher harmonics are excluded by ground-state selection (isotropy + orthogonality, already derived). So f(Θ) = C(Θ) = 2sin²(πΘ).

**Step 4:** Apply constraints 2 and 4. g(Ω, n) must encode dilution from Planck to observation on a bounded domain with the observer at √Ω. The hierarchy ratio is Ω, the observer sits at √Ω, and n counts manifold depth. The simplest function with these properties is (√Ω)⁻ⁿ. 

**Step 5 (the hard part):** Show (√Ω)⁻ⁿ is the ONLY function satisfying constraints 2 and 4 simultaneously. This is where the proof either closes or remains open.

---

## What Step 5 Requires

The argument needs a rigidity result: given a finite hierarchy Ω on a bounded domain with a unique midpoint at √Ω, what functions g(Ω, n) are consistent?

Candidate approaches:

| Approach | Idea | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Volume scaling | The ratio of n-dimensional volumes at scale √Ω vs scale Ω is (√Ω)⁻ⁿ. If observables are volume-weighted, this is forced. | Needs formalization. The volume scaling argument is stated in the engine file but not proved unique. |
| Spectral | The eigenvalue spacing on S³/2I at manifold depth n scales as Ω⁻ⁿ/². If measurement resolves eigenvalues, the scaling is forced. | Connects to Lemma 8 territory. May require extending spectral results. |
| Information-theoretic | The observer at √Ω has access to log(√Ω) = ½ log Ω bits per dimension. The information content at depth n is n × ½ log Ω. Exponentiating gives (√Ω)⁻ⁿ. | Attractive but requires defining "information" on S³/2I rigorously. |
| Representation-theoretic | The Peter-Weyl decomposition on S³/2I organizes modes by spin j. The amplitude at mode j relative to Planck is set by the Casimir scaling. If Casimir scaling reduces to (√Ω)⁻ⁿ under the 2I quotient, the hierarchy is forced. | Most technically demanding. Most likely to produce a clean theorem if it works. |

## What This Paper Would Establish

If the proof closes:

The scaling law is not an assumption. It is the unique measurement postulate compatible with S¹ = ∂M ↪ S³, ∂S³ = ∅, with anti-periodic BC and the 120-domain. The MIT analog of Gleason's theorem.

This would change the audit verdict on the scaling law from DECLARED to AXIOM (forced). Everything downstream (coupling constants, mass formula structure, Hubble tension mechanism) would inherit that upgrade.

The well assignments, manifold indices, and grid types would remain as the next layer of open work. The bridge would be secured. The traffic rules on the bridge would be the remaining target.

## Relationship to Existing Papers

| Paper | What it establishes | What this paper adds |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Sector A (Λ eigenvalue) | λ₀ = 2/R² on Möbius in S³ | That paper gives the eigenvalue. This paper shows the scaling law that reads it is unique. |
| Lemma 8 | Spectral inaccessibility at s ≠ 0 | That paper shows what the spectral geometry cannot access. This paper shows what the measurement postulate must be given those constraints. |
| Scaling Law (this paper) | Uniqueness of the sampling rule | Completes the triad: eigenvalue, boundary, measurement. |

## Notes

The strongest version of this result would show that the scaling law is the ONLY measurement rule, not merely the simplest. Simplicity arguments (Occam) are not proofs. Uniqueness arguments (Gleason) are.

If the proof cannot be completed as a uniqueness result, the fallback position is an explicit enumeration of alternatives and demonstration that each fails at least one constraint. That's weaker than Gleason but stronger than "we chose the simplest form."

The scaling law's status as measurement postulate vs derived equation is a question about the relationship between topology and observation. That question may be deeper than any single paper can resolve. The goal is to push the boundary as far as the math allows and honestly report where it stops.

---

*"The topology leaves no room for anything else" is either the strongest possible derivation or the most precise statement of what remains to be proved.*
