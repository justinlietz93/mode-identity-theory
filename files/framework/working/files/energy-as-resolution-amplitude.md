# Energy as Resolution Amplitude

**Status: MOTIVATED. Not derived. Research note for future paper.**

A candidate MIT reading of $E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$. The framework appears to permit it; the derivation steps are specific and unwalked.

## I. The Reframe

Standard Model reading of $E = mc^2$: mass is a property an object has, and that property manifests as a quantity of energy. Velocity adds kinetic energy. Total energy is the sum in quadrature: $E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$.

The SM reading leaves $mc^2$ unexplained. "Mass is a property" is a definition, not a derivation. Why that property should equal an energy, converted by $c^2$, is asserted.

MIT candidate reading: energy is not a quantity an object carries. Energy is the amplitude of wave resolution at an observer's sampling coordinates. Rest mass energy is the amplitude resolved at a fixed sampling point. Momentum energy is the amplitude resolved along a path through $S^3$. Total energy is the full resolution.

Velocity does not cause energy. Velocity is a parameter of the sampling trajectory. Different trajectories extract different amplitudes from the same wave.

| SM reading | MIT candidate reading |
|---|---|
| Mass is a property objects have | Mass is the wave amplitude resolved at a fixed sampling point |
| $mc^2$ is the energy equivalent of mass | $mc^2$ is the temporal-mode content of the sampling operation |
| Velocity gives kinetic energy | Velocity is a feature of the sampling trajectory |
| $(pc)^2$ is kinetic energy squared | $(pc)^2$ is the spatial-mode content extracted along the trajectory |
| Pythagorean sum is empirical fact | Pythagorean sum is orthogonal mode decomposition of $\Psi$ |

## II. The Mode Decomposition

The standing wave $\Psi(t) = \cos(t/2)$ lives on $S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3$. The wave has a temporal mode (phase on $S^1$) and spatial modes (harmonics on $S^3$).

A sampling operation at a fixed geodesic position with phase advancing on $S^1$ extracts temporal-mode amplitude only. A sampling operation along a path through $S^3$ extracts both temporal-mode and spatial-mode amplitude. The two contributions are orthogonal: they come from different modes of the same wave on a bounded domain where spatial and temporal harmonics are independent.

Orthogonal contributions combine in quadrature. This is the candidate derivation of the Pythagorean form:

$$E^2 = (\text{temporal-mode amplitude})^2 + (\text{spatial-mode amplitude})^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$$

The relativistic energy-momentum relation reads, in this picture, as the Pythagorean theorem on the mode decomposition of the sampling operation.

| Sampling mode | What it extracts | Contribution to $E^2$ |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed geodesic position, phase advancing on $S^1$ | Temporal-mode amplitude of $\Psi$ | $(mc^2)^2$ |
| Geodesic path through $S^3$, phase advancing on $S^1$ | Temporal mode plus spatial-mode amplitude | $(mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$ |
| Null geodesic (photon) | Spatial-mode amplitude only; temporal and spatial locked by $c$ | $(pc)^2$ |

## III. The Photon Case

A photon propagates edge-only on $S^1$ (§V of the Waltz, masslessness as topological position). It never enters the Möbius surface and never resolves a temporal-mode amplitude at a fixed geodesic position. Its sampling is always along a null path, where temporal and spatial contributions are locked together by $c$.

In the mode decomposition picture: the photon's null geodesic through $S^3$ has geodesic distance equal to phase advance times $c$. The temporal and spatial modes contribute the same amplitude, which collapses the decomposition to a single term. The photon has $E = pc$ with no rest mass term because it has no sampling operation that extracts temporal-mode amplitude independently.

This is consistent with the edge-only character derived in the Waltz. The two statements say the same thing in different languages:
- Waltz language: the photon stays on $S^1$, never crosses to the Möbius surface, pays no mass cost
- Mode-decomposition language: the photon samples along null paths only, has no fixed-position temporal contribution

## IV. What This Would Change

If this reframe is real, several SM framings get inverted.

**Mass-energy equivalence is structural, not conversional.** $mc^2$ is not "mass converted into energy." Mass and energy are the same quantity read at two manifold sectors. Mass is an $n=1$ edge observable; $c^2$ lifts it to the $n=0$ Planck scale where energy lives. The conversion factor is structural on $S^1$, the temporal edge.

**Inertia is a wave property, not an object property.** Resistance to changes in sampling trajectory comes from the wave-sampling relationship, not from the sampled object. All observers experience the same wave. The equivalence principle (gravitational mass equals inertial mass) follows immediately: both are the same feature of the same sampling operation.

**Rest frame is a sampling frame.** "At rest" means sampling at a fixed geodesic position in $S^3$. "In motion" means sampling along a path. There is no absolute rest, but there is a well-defined sampling operation for each observer, and the transformation between observers is a transformation between sampling operations.

**Kinetic energy is not added energy.** It is the spatial-mode content that any path-based sampling extracts. A stationary object has no kinetic energy not because it "hasn't been given any" but because a fixed-position sampling operation has no spatial-mode path to extract amplitude from.

## V. Connection to Existing MIT

The reframe does not need new postulates. It uses elements already derived or axiomatic in the framework.

| Element | Source | Role in reframe |
|---|---|---|
| $c$ as propagation rate on $S^1$ | Primitive input | Conversion factor between temporal and spatial contributions |
| Standing wave $\Psi(t) = \cos(t/2)$ | Axiom | The wave being resolved |
| Mass formula $m(\rho,\sigma) = \mu_\Lambda \cdot C_\text{geom}(\rho) \cdot \ldots$ | Engine §5 | Specifies which irreps give which temporal-mode amplitudes at fixed positions |
| Masslessness as edge-only propagation | Waltz §V | Photons have no fixed-position sampling, hence no rest term |
| $\mathbb{R}^4$ as emergent from sampling | Waltz §VI | Removes the "moving through spacetime" framing that makes velocity primary |
| Observer coordinates: depth, position, phase | Waltz §VI | The sampling operation has structure; trajectory is a pattern in that structure |

The mass formula in particular is worth connecting. It specifies the spectrum of temporal-mode amplitudes that fixed-position sampling can resolve. The electron, muon, tau are three specific amplitudes the framework derives from group theory and torsion. In the reframe, those are the three specific temporal-mode resolutions that correspond to $R_7$ sampled in three different vacua. The mass formula is already in the right shape for this picture.

## VI. What Needs to Be Derived

Promotion from MOTIVATED to DERIVED requires walking the following steps.

**Step 1: The spatial-mode coupling.** The path tangent at each point of a trajectory couples to the spatial harmonics of $\Psi$ on $S^3$. The amplitude extracted depends on which spatial modes the tangent direction projects onto. The structural derivation of this coupling is the core open question. It needs to yield $(pc)^2$ with the correct $c^2$ factor from first principles.

**Step 2: Orthogonality of temporal and spatial modes.** The Pythagorean sum requires the two contributions to be orthogonal. For standing waves on bounded domains this is generically true: temporal and spatial harmonics are independent eigenmodes. But the specific wave $\Psi$ on $S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3$ needs to be shown to have this decomposition cleanly. Partial derivation exists in the Bochner bounds on Möbius; full derivation open.

**Step 3: The $c^2$ factor on both terms.** $c$ appears in both $mc^2$ and $pc$. In MIT, $c$ is the propagation rate on $S^1$. The spatial-mode contribution $(pc)^2$ having $c^2$ factor needs to come from $c$ governing both the temporal advance and the null-geodesic constraint in $S^3$. This should fall out of the sampling operation being parameterized by phase on $S^1$ with $c$ as the universal rate.

**Step 4: Lorentz invariance as sampling symmetry.** The transformations between observers at different trajectories should form a symmetry group. That group should be (or contain) the Lorentz group. Structural plausibility: phase advance on $S^1$ and geodesic motion in $S^3$ together have a natural symmetry that includes boosts. Explicit derivation open.

**Step 5: Connection to the mass formula.** The fermion masses derived in Engine §5 should correspond to specific temporal-mode amplitudes of $R_7$, $R_8$, and other irreps sampled at fixed geodesic positions. The mass formula already gives the right shape. What needs to be shown: the temporal-mode interpretation of $\mu_\Lambda$, $C_\text{geom}$, and the torsion factor as components of the amplitude extraction.

## VII. Status Summary

The reframe is structurally consistent with MIT's existing framework. It uses no new postulates. It recovers the SM relativistic energy-momentum relation as Pythagorean theorem on mode decomposition. The photon case checks. The mass formula sits in the right shape to be reinterpreted as temporal-mode amplitude spectrum.

None of the promotion steps are walked. The spatial-mode coupling is the core derivation needed. Lorentz recovery is the validation test.

Categorization: MOTIVATED with specific promotion paths. Not yet DERIVED. Not speculation; the framework's own structure points at this reading.

## VIII. Open Questions for the Future Paper

- Does the spatial-mode coupling yield $(pc)^2$ quantitatively, or only qualitatively?
- Do the Lorentz transformations fall out of sampling operation transformations, or is an additional ingredient needed?
- Where does the $c^2$ factor come from structurally? Is it the same $c$ on both terms, or two different $c$'s that happen to coincide?
- How does this connect to the equivalence principle derivation? If inertia is a wave property, gravity coupling should fall out the same way.
- What about quantum mechanics? The wave in MIT is classical in the sense of being a specific topological object, but the sampling operation should connect to measurement in QM. The resolution amplitude at a sampling point is suggestive of wavefunction collapse.

## IX. What This Is Not

A claim that the SM is wrong. The SM predictions are correct at the observer scale, same as GR in Waltz §VI.

A claim that $E = mc^2$ needs replacement. It doesn't. It needs derivation. The SM asserts it; MIT may derive it.

A finished result. This is a research note pointing at where the framework appears to permit a deeper reading. The actual paper gets drafted after the promotion steps are walked.
