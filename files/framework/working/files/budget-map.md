# The Budget Map

**Status (2026-06-21):** One conserved budget in this sector, the temporal $\Psi^2 + S^2 = 1$, with the spatial $u_0^2 + J^2 = 1$ as its twin. Temperature and entropy are two readings of the budget's single state variable $S$, not budgets of their own; the Waltz clock is a map from phase to time, not a budget. This note is the inventory the detail pages point back to.

**Related:** [The Temporal Budget Identity](temporal-budget.md), [Redshift and Cooling](redshift-and-cooling.md), [Energy as Resolution Amplitude](energy-as-resolution-amplitude.md), [Entropy as Realization Budget](entropy-as-realization-budget.md), [The Waltz](../../../spectrum/files/the-waltz.md), [Cosmological Constant](../../../cosmos/files/cosmological-constant.md) (spatial budget).

## The point

The budget, the things read off it, and the clock that times it are spread across several notes, and from a distance they read as three or four parallel budgets. There is one budget in this sector, with a twin in the spatial sector. Temperature and entropy are not budgets; they are two readings of the budget's single state variable $S$. The Waltz clock is not a budget either; it is the map from phase to time. Keeping these straight is not housekeeping: treating entropy as its own primitive budget is exactly what produced the scale error the [entropy note](entropy-as-realization-budget.md) had to fix, counting modes where it should count configurations. This map is the inventory.

## The inventory

| Object | Identity or law | Kind | Conserved | What it fixes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Temporal budget | $\Psi^2 + S^2 = 1$ | budget | yes | the state $S$; the realization partition |
| Spatial budget | $u_0^2 + J^2 = 1$ | budget (twin) | yes | $\Lambda$, through the 3/2 Gauss factor |
| Temperature | $T \propto 1/S$ | reading of $S$ | no | per-mode energy; cooling and the thermal redshift law |
| Entropy | $\Sigma = k_B \ln W_\text{micro}(S)$ | reading of $S$ | no, grows | configurations over realized modes; the rising trend |
| Waltz clock | $dt/d\tau = S^{-1/2}$ | map | not applicable | $H(z)$, distances, redshift kinematics |

## The one budget, and its twin

$\Psi^2 + S^2 = 1$, with $\Psi = \cos(t/2)$ the unresolved standing wave and $S = \sin(t/2)$ the realized-mode content. It is conserved by construction and has one state variable, $S$. Everything thermodynamic on this page is a function of that one number. The spatial budget $u_0^2 + J^2 = 1$ is its structural twin on the Möbius wavefunction, fixing $\Lambda$ through the Gauss 3/2 that the clock's exponent numerically matches (a correspondence still open); it is the only other genuine budget in the framework.

## The two readings

Temperature and entropy are the intensity and the spread of the same budget state. As the budget transfers $\Psi^2 \to S^2$, the energy moves from few realized modes into many: per-mode intensity falls ($T \propto 1/S$, the cooling) while the configuration count climbs ($\Sigma = k_B \ln W_\text{micro}$, the rising trend; the arrow proper is the sampling, see the [entropy note](entropy-as-realization-budget.md) §III). They move in opposite directions because they are conjugate faces of one transfer, the first law showing through, not two ledgers disagreeing.

The anti-circularity lesson lives here. Entropy is a reading of $S$, computed as the microstate count over the phase space $S$ sets, not a relabeling of $S$ itself. Read it the second way and the entropy collapses to the definition, and to the wrong scale (the [entropy note](entropy-as-realization-budget.md) walks the failure). The budget supplies the state; the readings are computed over it.

## The clock, not a budget

$dt/d\tau = S^{-1/2}$ maps the budget's phase to proper time. It is what turns $S$ into observable cosmology: $H(z)$, distances, and the redshift kinematics that fit Pantheon+ and DESI BAO ([temporal budget §II-III](temporal-budget.md)). It is a map, not a conserved sum, so it is not a budget; it rides on the same $S$.

## Out of scope

One entropy ledger sits outside the budget: the gravitational one (Weyl curvature, clumping, black holes), which is Penrose's low-entropy-past puzzle and the dominant share of the universe's entropy. The realization reading accounts for the arrow in its own sector and leaves the gravitational ledger open ([entropy note §V](entropy-as-realization-budget.md)). This map covers the realization sector; it does not annex the gravitational one.

## Where it stands

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Temporal budget identity $\Psi^2 + S^2 = 1$ | PROPOSED; consistent with data |
| Cooling, $T \propto 1/S$ | ESTABLISHED as kinematic equivalence (redshift and cooling) |
| Waltz clock and the $H(z)$ fit | ESTABLISHED at model level ($\Delta\chi^2 = +0.11$ vs ΛCDM, SN+BAO) |
| Entropy reading | MOTIVATED; rests on the unwalked shell-unlock map $S \mapsto N_\text{max}(S)$ that sets $W_\text{modes}$ |
| Realized-sector energy $E(S)$ | OPEN, highest-leverage: pins the entropy map and is the redshift energy counterparty (entropy note §VIII) |
| Spatial budget and $\Lambda$ | from the surface eigenvalue (cosmological constant) |
| Clock from the postulate, $t_\text{now}$ from topology, Friedmann as output | OPEN |
