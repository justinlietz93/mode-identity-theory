# The Sampling Kernel's Symmetry

**Status (2026-07-05):** The P2 theorem track, and only that. Question and verdict table frozen in commit `e84fef7`; the chase run in the following commit; the git history is the audit trail. Verdict: SUPPORTED, upgraded by reduction (§IV): the adjoint-identity shape is realized concretely on the budget's own complex line, no intrinsic arrow exists anywhere in the structural inventory, and P2 reduces to R1 (magnitude-only registration, prior doctrine) plus R2 (state-free rate rule, a structural premise); DERIVED is withheld at two named blocks. This note is deliberately narrow: it does not cite, anticipate, or lean on the $\epsilon$ fit (the P2 measurement track, registered on the [tick lemma](tick-lemma.md) and independent of everything here), it does not touch the entropy channel, and it does not move the budget page's FORCED label, which waits on both tracks plus review per the [tracker](friedmann-as-output.md).

**Related:** [The Tick Lemma](tick-lemma.md) (where P2 lives), [The Half-Power Clock](friedmann-as-output.md), [Temporal Budget](temporal-budget.md) (the complex phase form used below), [first-eigenvalue](../../bedrock/files/first-eigenvalue.md) (the model of self-adjoint discipline; see the fence in §I).

## I. The Question, the Verdicts, the Obligations

> Does the elementary sampling kernel inherit exchange symmetry from a self-adjoint structure the framework already carries, or is kernel symmetry an added sampling postulate?

Three verdicts, posted before the chase:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DERIVED | a concrete structure forces equal forward and reverse elementary magnitudes; P2 becomes theorem-level relative to prior framework structure |
| SUPPORTED | the structure motivates or partially reduces the symmetry but a named premise survives; P2 stays a premise, better anchored |
| FAILED | the kernel carries an intrinsic arrow somewhere in the framework's own structure; the tick lemma loses the overlap selection and the tracker's failure bar activates |

Proof obligations, posted with the question so the chase cannot drift into "Hermitian means symmetric means done": the argument must exhibit the actual **space** the kernel acts on, the actual **pairing**, and the actual **kernel**, and must state which framework page supplies each. Two fences. First, the [first-eigenvalue pillar](../../bedrock/files/first-eigenvalue.md) supplies a *model* of self-adjoint discipline (its proved realizations of the twisted Laplacian: the Friedrichs extension with bottom $0$ and the sector-regular bridging family; first positive level $2/R^2$); it does not supply the sampling kernel, and no descent map from the spatial operator to the temporal sampling structure exists or is claimed here. Self-adjointness of the spatial operator does not automatically descend. Second, the target shape is the adjoint identity, $\langle A, K I\rangle = \langle K A, I\rangle$: two orientations of one underlying sampling form, with direction appearing only when a state is supplied. If that shape cannot be realized on a concrete space, the honest verdict is SUPPORTED or FAILED, not a gestured DERIVED.

---

## II. The Construction

**The space.** The budget page already carries it: the complex phase form $\Psi + iS = e^{it/2}$ ([temporal-budget](temporal-budget.md) §I), a one-complex-dimensional bookkeeping line with orthonormal directions $e_{\text{st}}$ (the standing axis) and $e_{\text{re}}$ (the realized axis), state $u(t) = e^{it/2}$. The line is one-dimensional because the wave is the selected $m = 0$ harmonic; the simplicity is the ground-state selection's doing, not an evasion.

**The pairing.** The one the budget identity already uses: $\lvert u \rvert^2 = \Psi^2 + S^2 = 1$. The framework treats the diagonal of this pairing as the physical content (the shares $\Psi^2$, $S^2$); registration is evaluation of squared magnitudes in it.

**The kernel.** The realized-axis projector $P_{\text{re}} = \lvert e_{\text{re}}\rangle\langle e_{\text{re}}\rvert$. The tick's draw element is $m(t) = \langle e_{\text{re}}, u(t)\rangle$, with $\lvert m \rvert = S$; its deposit is the registration $\langle u, P_{\text{re}}\, u\rangle = \lvert m \rvert^2$. The projector is manifestly self-adjoint, so the adjoint-identity shape posted in §I is realized concretely: $\langle a, P_{\text{re}}\, i\rangle = \langle P_{\text{re}}\, a, i\rangle$, and the two orientations of the sampling form are conjugates, $\langle e_{\text{re}}, u\rangle$ and $\langle u, e_{\text{re}}\rangle$, equal in magnitude at $S$. The elementary kernel carries no intrinsic direction; direction appears only once a state is supplied. The obligations of §I are met: space, pairing, kernel, each from a named page.

**A side payoff that tightens P0.** The level stocks are the moment ladder of this one element: $\lvert m \rvert^0\,dt$ (count), $\lvert m \rvert\,dt = S\,dt$ (amplitude), $\lvert m \rvert^2\,dt = S^2\,dt$ (intensity). The gate-(i) level assignment is thereby recovered from the pairing plus the registration doctrine rather than posited, and the tick lemma's overlap weight is the $3/2$ moment of the same element.

**The reduction theorem.** Name two premises:

- **R1 (magnitude-only access):** the observer's rate rule is built from registrable data. The registration doctrine (observers register intensity; the $\lvert\cdot\rvert^2$ that grounds $C(\Theta)$ and the 60-grid) makes registered data functions of $\lvert m \rvert$, so the elementary coupling enters any observer-built rate through $\lvert m \rvert$ alone.
- **R2 (structural rule):** the rate rule is state-free, defined from the postulate layer (geometry, boundary conditions, grids), with the state entering rates only through the ledger stocks.

> **Claim.** R1 and R2 imply exchange symmetry of the elementary kernel: $\epsilon = 0$ in the asymmetry family of the [tick lemma](tick-lemma.md) §III.

*Argument.* Within that family, $\epsilon \ne 0$ requires an orientation resource in the rule: it must weight source against sink. Reversing the elementary act conjugates $m$ and swaps source with sink; conjugation is invisible under R1, so the element supplies no orientation. R2 forbids importing orientation from the state into the rule itself. And the structural inventory supplies none: the geometry is static, the wave equation reversible, the boundary conditions symmetric, and the kernel just exhibited is self-adjoint. The framework's only time-asymmetric object is the state ($\Psi(0) = +1$), and its entry point (the stocks) is already accounted. No resource remains; the rate function is symmetric in (source, sink), and $\epsilon = 0$. $\square$ (as a reduction; the premises carry the status below)

---

## III. What Blocks DERIVED

Three blocks, each named rather than papered over.

1. **The space's own label.** The budget page calls the complex form "a bookkeeping representation of the two real budget components, not an additional complex field," a caveat that exists deliberately. The construction above inherits that status: the projector is a kernel on the bookkeeping of a structure. Promoting the line from bookkeeping to structure is a framework decision with costs elsewhere, not a move this note can make in passing.
2. **R2 is a premise.** Precisely located now (the rule is state-free), and supported by inventory: every rule the framework has exhibited is structural (the anti-periodic BC, the gates, the measurement rule), and a state-oriented rate rule would be a novel object class appearing nowhere else. Support is not proof.
3. **No descent map.** The [first-eigenvalue pillar](../../bedrock/files/first-eigenvalue.md)'s self-adjoint realizations are spatial operators on $M(W)$; nothing here descends from them, and the fence of §I stands: they model the discipline, they do not supply this kernel.

---

## IV. Verdict

**SUPPORTED, upgraded by reduction.** The FAILED row did not fire: the chase found no intrinsic arrow anywhere in the framework's structure, and the adjoint-identity shape is realized concretely rather than gestured. The DERIVED row did not fire either, blocked at the two named points (the bookkeeping status of the space; R2's premise status). What the chase delivers is the reduction: P2 is no longer a free symmetry postulate but a consequence of R1 (prior registration doctrine) and R2 (a structural premise with an inventory argument), with the level assignment P0 partially derived as a side effect. The tick lemma's ledger should carry this: the load-bearing residue is now R2 alone.

What would promote to DERIVED later: an independent reason to grant the complex form structural rather than bookkeeping status (or a realization of the same construction on a space that needs no promotion), and R2 made theorem-shaped (rules defined from a time-symmetric structure cannot carry a physical orientation; conventions are not structure). Both are real questions, neither is attempted here.

Track separation, restated at the close: the $\epsilon$ fit is the measurement of the same dial and it remains untouched, unpredicted, and uncited by this note. If the fit lands off zero, R1 or R2 is wrong somewhere and this note says where to look; if it brackets zero, that is the fit's finding, not this note's.

---

*The kernel is a projector on the budget's own line. The arrow has nowhere to live but the state, and the state was already counted.*

---

*One form, two orientations. Either the structure supplies it, or the postulate gets named.*
