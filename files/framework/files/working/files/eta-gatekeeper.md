# The η-gatekeeper: $Q$ versus $Q'$ on $S^3/2I$

**Status (2026-07-01):** Step 1 of the postulate-bridge staged plan, closed; gate open. The boundary rho difference is $8/5$ in magnitude, nonzero and Galois-sourced. Step 2 fixes the orientation: on the resolution boundary, $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-8/5$, and the magnitude $73/15$ is now anchored in print (BHKK); see [Step 2](step2-analytic-setup.md). The interior classes are computed in [Step 3](step3-interior-classes.md); the coupling identity is Step 4.

**Related:** [Postulate bridge](postulate-bridge.md), [First eigenvalue](../../bedrock/files/first-eigenvalue.md), [Coexact gap](../../bedrock/files/coexact-gap.md).

**Goal.** Decide whether the boundary carries a nonzero, connection-sensitive spectral asymmetry separating $Q$ from its Galois conjugate $Q'$, sourced by the same $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt5)$ arithmetic that makes the coexact gap $36/R^2$ rather than $4/R^2$. Boundary-only, independent of the filling. A zero or Galois-blind answer stops the program.

> **Convention (fixed before computing).** $\rho_\alpha$ is the APS odd-signature rho invariant in the **unreduced** normalization $\rho_\alpha=\eta_\alpha-\dim(\alpha)\,\eta_{\mathrm{triv}}$. Orient $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ **as the boundary $\partial W$ of the $E_8$ plumbing** chosen in Step 2 (not merely the Seifert orientation), with the APS II sign of the $G$-signature defect; the sign of the answer is fixed by that choice and is what Step 4 reads as match-or-oppose. Under the reduced convention $\bar\eta=(\eta+h)/2$ (here $h=0$, so $\bar\eta=\eta/2$), every rho difference below is halved. The magnitude and the golden-class support are independent of the orientation choice.

## 1. The object

$M=S^3/2I=\Sigma(2,3,5)$, round radius $R$, $2I$ acting by left translation. The irreducible flat $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ connections are the two $2$-dimensional irreps: the defining $Q$ (McKay distance $1$) and its Galois conjugate $Q'$ (distance $7$). Both are isolated and nondegenerate (Fintushel-Stern), so the adjoints $\mathrm{ad}_Q,\mathrm{ad}_{Q'}$ are acyclic ($H^0=H^1=0$); complexified, $\mathrm{ad}_\rho\cong\mathrm{Sym}^2\rho$, the $3$-dimensional irreps at distances $2$ and $6$ (the coexact gap is the squared McKay distance over $R^2$: $4/R^2$ for $\mathrm{ad}_Q$, $36/R^2$ for $\mathrm{ad}_{Q'}$).

The primary invariant is the APS odd-signature rho invariant $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}\rho}(M)$, the boundary quantity the index theorem on $W$ requires in Step 4.

> **Remark (relation to the adjoint curl $\ast d_\nabla$).** The odd signature operator acts on $\Omega^0\oplus\Omega^1(M;\mathrm{ad})$. Acyclicity removes the harmonic representatives ($h=0$), not the exact spectral ladder: the exact $1$-forms $d_\nabla f$ still carry the positive twisted-function spectrum. That sector is invisible to the spectral asymmetry. (For $\Delta_\nabla f=\lambda f$, $\lambda>0$, the operator exchanges $(f,0)$ and $(0,\,d_\nabla f/\sqrt\lambda)$ with opposite signs, so its eigenvalues on that pair are $\pm\sqrt\lambda$, which cancel in the signed count.) The asymmetry lives entirely on the coexact sector, where the operator restricts to $\ast d_\nabla$ with signed spectrum $\pm m/R$; so $\eta(\text{odd signature})=\eta(\ast d_\nabla\ \text{coexact})$, and with $h=0$ this is $\rho$.

## 2. The tool

For flat unitary $\alpha$ on $S^3/\Gamma$, $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{SU}(2)$ acting through the defining representation, the APS II $G$-signature defect gives
$$\rho_\alpha(S^3/\Gamma)=\frac{1}{\lvert\Gamma\rvert}\sum_{1\neq g\in\Gamma}\bigl(\chi_\alpha(g)-\dim\alpha\bigr)\,\cot\tfrac{\theta_1(g)}{2}\cot\tfrac{\theta_2(g)}{2},$$
with $g$ having defining eigenvalues $e^{\pm i\phi}$, so $\theta_1=\phi,\theta_2=-\phi$ and per-element defect $-\cot^2\tfrac{\phi}{2}$ (the opposite boundary orientation, or the opposite APS defect convention, flips this factor's sign; that flip is exactly the overall sign, fixed in [Step 2](step2-analytic-setup.md) to $-8/5$ on the resolution boundary). Only the difference is needed; $\dim=3$ for both, so the $\dim\alpha$ term cancels:
$$\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=\frac{1}{120}\sum_{1\neq g}\bigl(\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q'}(g)-\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q}(g)\bigr)\Bigl(-\cot^2\tfrac{\phi_g}{2}\Bigr).$$

## 3. Character input

$\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q}=\chi_Q^2-1=1+2\cos 2\phi$; $\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q'}=\sigma(\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q})$, $\sigma:\sqrt5\mapsto-\sqrt5$; $\varphi=\tfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$.

| $\phi$ | order | $\lvert C\rvert$ | $\chi_Q$ | $\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q}$ | $\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q'}$ | $\Delta$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $0$ | 1 | 1 | $2$ | $3$ | $3$ | $0$ |
| $\pi$ | 2 | 1 | $-2$ | $3$ | $3$ | $0$ |
| $\pi/2$ | 4 | 30 | $0$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $0$ |
| $2\pi/3$ | 3 | 20 | $-1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $\pi/3$ | 6 | 20 | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $\pi/5$ | 10 | 12 | $\varphi$ | $\varphi$ | $-1/\varphi$ | $-\sqrt5$ |
| $2\pi/5$ | 5 | 12 | $1/\varphi$ | $-1/\varphi$ | $\varphi$ | $+\sqrt5$ |
| $3\pi/5$ | 10 | 12 | $-1/\varphi$ | $-1/\varphi$ | $\varphi$ | $+\sqrt5$ |
| $4\pi/5$ | 5 | 12 | $-\varphi$ | $\varphi$ | $-1/\varphi$ | $-\sqrt5$ |

($\Delta=\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q'}-\chi_{\mathrm{Sym}^2Q}$.) Supported entirely on the four golden ($\sqrt5$) classes; the five rational classes cancel.

## 4. The computation

Each golden class has $12$ elements, $\phi/2\in\{\pi/10,\pi/5,3\pi/10,2\pi/5\}$:
$$\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=\frac{12}{120}\sqrt5\Bigl[\cot^2\tfrac{\pi}{10}-\cot^2\tfrac{\pi}{5}-\cot^2\tfrac{3\pi}{10}+\cot^2\tfrac{2\pi}{5}\Bigr].$$
With $\cot^2\tfrac{\pi}{10}=5+2\sqrt5$, $\cot^2\tfrac{\pi}{5}=1+\tfrac{2}{\sqrt5}$, $\cot^2\tfrac{3\pi}{10}=5-2\sqrt5$, $\cot^2\tfrac{2\pi}{5}=1-\tfrac{2}{\sqrt5}$, the bracket is $\tfrac{16\sqrt5}{5}$, so
$$\boxed{\ \rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=\frac{\sqrt5}{10}\cdot\frac{16\sqrt5}{5}=\frac{8}{5}\quad(\text{unreduced};\ 4/5\ \text{reduced})\ }$$
The $\sqrt5$ cancels in the class sum, leaving the rational $8/5$, as expected for this finite-image spherical calculation.

## 5. Reading

- **Nonzero.** The boundary asymmetry distinguishes $Q$ from $Q'$.
- **Galois-sourced.** The whole difference comes from the four $\sqrt5$-classes, the locus of the automorphism sending $\mathrm{Sym}^2Q$ (distance $2$, gap $4/R^2$) to $\mathrm{Sym}^2Q'$ (distance $6$, gap $36/R^2$).
- **Not the same invariant as the gap.** Rho is signed asymmetry; the gap is first absolute occurrence. Both are sensitive to the same Galois separation between $\mathrm{Sym}^2Q$ and $\mathrm{Sym}^2Q'$; neither computes the other.
- **Denominator $5$.** Consistent with the contribution being supported on the order-$5$ / order-$10$ classes.

## 6. Normalization check (closed; orientation sign fixed in Step 2)

The magnitude and the reduced/unreduced normalization are validated against $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ data by an independent route (Appendix A). This is a mod-$\mathbb Z$ test, insensitive to the overall sign.

Helle (Ex. B.15) gives $cs(Q)=-1/120$; solving $(2-Q)H=Q-Q'$ on the affine $E_8$ graph gives the augmentation $\varepsilon(H)=\langle H,\delta\rangle=-72$ ($H$ is virtual, so this is a signed count, not a dimension), whence $cs(Q)-cs(Q')=-72/120=-3/5\equiv 2/5\pmod{\mathbb Z}$ (so $cs(Q')=-49/120$). By the adjoint/fundamental Dynkin index $T(\mathrm{adj})/T(\mathrm{fund})=4$, the adjoint CS difference is $4\cdot(-3/5)=-12/5\equiv 3/5\pmod{\mathbb Z}$. The relation $\rho\equiv cs(\mathrm{ad})\pmod{\mathbb Z}$ compares this residue class with the $G$-signature value from §4, whose residue is $8/5\equiv 3/5$: they agree.

Precisely what this fixes:
- **Supports the unreduced normalization** (under the stated APS/CS convention). The reduced value $4/5\equiv 4/5$ does not match $3/5$; only the unreduced $8/5\equiv 3/5$ does. Treat this as a mod-$\mathbb Z$ consistency check, not the source of the real value $8/5$.
- **Does not determine the real number.** $8/5$ is the $G$-signature result (§4) alone; the CS route fixes only the residue class $3/5\pmod{\mathbb Z}$, not the real constant relating $\rho$ to CS. (The apparent real coincidence "$8/5=8/5$" comes from choosing the $2/5$ representative before multiplying by $4$; the $-3/5$ representative gives $-12/5$, the same class.)
- **Sign-insensitive.** The chain compares $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}$ with $cs(\mathrm{ad}Q)-cs(\mathrm{ad}Q')$ in opposite order; mod $\mathbb Z$ these are the same class, so the flip is invisible and silently carries the $\rho$-to-$cs$ sign, which is exactly the residual below.

The Floer gradings $1,5\bmod 8$ are consistent (two distinct connections). **Sign (fixed in Step 2):** orienting $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ as $\partial W$ of the minimal resolution gives $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-8/5$; the $+8/5$ above is the reversed ($X_{+1}=-\Sigma$) orientation, and the $73/15$ magnitude is anchored in print (BHKK, spectral-flow integrality). See [Step 2](step2-analytic-setup.md).

## Verdict: the gate is open

The $G$-signature computation gives $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=8/5$ in magnitude (unreduced APS odd-signature normalization); Step 2 fixes the sign to $-8/5$ on the resolution-boundary orientation. The difference is nonzero and supported entirely on the golden conjugacy classes. The CS/McKay computation independently matches the residue class $3/5\pmod{\mathbb Z}$ under the stated APS/CS convention, supporting the normalization (Appendix A). The Step-1 gate is open, and Steps 2-3 (framework, sign, interior classes) are done; the coupling identity, revised by [Step 3](step3-interior-classes.md) to a three-ingredient test, remains Step 4.

## Appendix A. Fundamental Chern-Simons via the affine $E_8$ solve

Helle, Example B.15: for any finite $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{SU}(2)$ the canonical (defining) connection has $cs(Q)=-1/\lvert\Gamma\rvert$ (orientation reversal flips the sign), so $cs(Q)=-1/120$ on $2I$. Proposition B.16: for two connections, $cs(\alpha)-cs(\beta)=\varepsilon(H)/\lvert\Gamma\rvert$, where $\varepsilon(H)=\langle H,\delta\rangle$ is the augmentation (the honest dimension when $H$ is an actual representation) and $(2-Q)H=\alpha-\beta$ in $R(\Gamma)$.

Multiplication by $Q=V_1$ is the McKay adjacency $A$, so $(2-Q)\cdot=(2I-A)$ on the affine $E_8$ graph. Index the $9$ nodes by McKay distance with Coxeter marks $\delta=(1,2,3,4,5,6,4,2,3)$; edges $0\!-\!1\!-\!2\!-\!3\!-\!4\!-\!5\!-\!6\!-\!7$ and the branch $5\!-\!8$. $Q$ is the mark-$2$ node at distance $1$ (node $1$), $Q'$ the mark-$2$ node at distance $7$ (node $7$). Solvability: $\langle e_1-e_7,\delta\rangle=2-2=0$.

Solving $(2I-A)H=e_1-e_7$ with gauge $h_0=0$:
$$H=(h_0,\dots,h_8)=(0,\,0,\,-1,\,-2,\,-3,\,-4,\,-3,\,-2,\,-2).$$
(Back-substitution is forced; the node-$7$ equation checks: $2(-2)-(-3)=-1$.) Then
$$\varepsilon(H)=\langle H,\delta\rangle=-3-8-15-24-12-4-6=-72\quad(\text{signed; }H\text{ is virtual}),$$
$$cs(Q)-cs(Q')=\frac{-72}{120}=-\frac35\equiv\frac25\pmod{\mathbb Z},\qquad cs(Q')=-\frac{1}{120}+\frac{72}{120}=\frac{71}{120}\equiv-\frac{49}{120}.$$

The consistency check is three residues mod $\mathbb Z$, kept separate so the agreement is not read as a real-number coincidence:
1. **Fundamental CS difference:** $cs(Q)-cs(Q')=-3/5\equiv 2/5$.
2. **Adjoint index ($\times 4$):** $cs(\mathrm{ad}Q)-cs(\mathrm{ad}Q')\equiv 4\cdot(-3/5)\equiv 3/5$.
3. **Rho residue:** the $G$-signature value $8/5\equiv 3/5$.

The three agree mod $\mathbb Z$; the real number $8/5$ is claim 3's alone.
