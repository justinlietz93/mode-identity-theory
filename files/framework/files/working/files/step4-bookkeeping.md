# Step 4 of the postulate bridge, part one: the bookkeeping

**Status (2026-07-01):** Closed (part one of Step 4). The four items carried from Steps 2-3 are closed by exact computation, and the three ingredients of the revised Step 4 now compute in one currency, character sums on $2I$: the odd-signature rho is an affine function of the KN Dirac-type sums (the conversion identity, gate value $-8/5=4\,\Delta D$); the KN tautological K-class is pinned, its charges reproducing the Step-2 Chern-Simons web mod 1 in all four sectors; the boundary sign convention is pinned ($\eta_{\mathrm{Dir}}=1079/720$ on $+\Sigma$), triply locked; and $\bar\mu=-1$, verified exactly through Ruberman-Saveliev. Part two is resolved in [Step 4, part two](step4-coupling.md): route-specific decoupling, with the gauge dictionary as the positive residue. Numerical claims are exact; the worksheet is [step4-bookkeeping.test.py](step4-bookkeeping.test.py).

**Related:** [Step 3](step3-interior-classes.md), [Step 2](step2-analytic-setup.md), [η-gatekeeper (Step 1)](eta-gatekeeper.md), [Postulate bridge](postulate-bridge.md).

**Goal.** Close the four carried items: (1) reconcile the Dirac-type boundary sums of the Kronheimer-Nakajima formulas with the bridge's odd-signature rho; (2) identify the K-class of the charge-carrying extension; (3) pin the boundary-correction sign convention; (4) pin the $\bar\mu$ normalization for the characteristic-slot machinery. All four close, and more tightly than expected: the four quantities turn out to compute in a single currency, the character sums
$$D_W \;=\; \frac{1}{120}\sum_{1\neq g\in 2I}\frac{\chi_W(g)}{2-\chi_Q(g)},$$
so the three ingredients of the revised Step 4 now share one exact-arithmetic language. Every number below is an exact rational verified by the worksheet ([step4-bookkeeping.test.py](step4-bookkeeping.test.py)); nothing is floating-point.

**Conventions.** Orientation $+\Sigma$ (link = quotient = resolution boundary; Step 2's dictionary). $2-\chi_Q(g)=4\sin^2(\phi_g/2)$ with $\phi_g$ the defining-representation angle, so every $D_W$ is a positive-denominator character sum; the values used below are
$$D_{\mathrm{triv}}=\tfrac{1079}{1440},\quad D_Q=\tfrac{73}{144},\quad D_{Q'}=-\tfrac{67}{720},\quad D_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=\tfrac{9}{32},\quad D_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}=-\tfrac{19}{160}.$$
By KN (A.2) with one factor trivial, $D_W=\int_X \mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{R}_W)\hat{A}$: the same sums are simultaneously boundary data and interior Chern-Weil integrals. That double role is what unifies the bookkeeping.

## 1. Item 1: the conversion identity (Dirac-type sums determine the odd-signature rho)

The two boundary invariants weight the same group elements differently: the $G$-signature defect uses $\pm\cot^2(\phi/2)$ (orientation-dependent), the Dirac-type sums use $1/(2-\chi_Q)=1/(4\sin^2(\phi/2))$. These are not independent. On $X_{+1}=-\Sigma$ the defect is $-\cot^2(\phi/2)=1-\frac{4}{2-\chi_Q}$ (Step 1's convention); reversing orientation to $+\Sigma$ flips the sign, so the $+\Sigma$ defect is
$$+\cot^2(\phi/2)\;=\;-1+\frac{4}{2-\chi_Q},$$
and summing against $\chi_\alpha-\dim\alpha$ with character orthogonality ($\sum_{g\neq 1}\chi_\alpha(g)=-\dim\alpha$ when $\alpha$ contains no trivial constituent) gives, for every representation with no trivial constituent,
$$\boxed{\ \rho^{\mathrm{sign}}_\alpha(+\Sigma)\;=\;\dim\alpha\;+\;4\bigl(D_\alpha-\dim\alpha\cdot D_{\mathrm{triv}}\bigr)\ }$$
(on $X_{+1}$ both sides flip sign). The no-trivial-constituent hypothesis is sharp: for $\alpha=\beta\oplus\mathbf{1}$ the left side equals $\rho_\beta$ while the right side gains the trivial multiplicity as an additive offset (checked: $\alpha=Q\oplus\mathbf{1}$ gives offset exactly $1$). Verified on all four representations:

| $\alpha$ | $\dim+4(D_\alpha-\dim D_{\mathrm{triv}})$ | known $\rho^{\mathrm{sign}}_\alpha(+\Sigma)$ |
|---|---|---|
| $Q$ | $-59/30$ | $-59/30$ (BHKK's printed $59/30$ on $X_{+1}$) |
| $Q'$ | $-131/30$ | $-131/30$ (BHKK's printed $131/30$ on $X_{+1}$) |
| $\mathrm{ad}\,Q$ | $-73/15$ | $-73/15$ (Steps 1-2) |
| $\mathrm{ad}\,Q'$ | $-97/15$ | $-97/15$ (Steps 1-2) |

So the reconciliation is an equation, not a dictionary: the Dirac-type sums that the KN index formula uses **determine** the odd-signature rho for flat twists on $S^3/\Gamma$, and conversely. Two corollaries:

- Since the dimensions agree, differences obey $\Delta\rho^{\mathrm{sign}}=4\,\Delta D$: the Step-1 gate value is $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=4\,(D_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-D_{\mathrm{ad}Q})=4\cdot(-\tfrac{2}{5})=-\tfrac{8}{5}$ on $+\Sigma$. The boundary Galois asymmetry is visible in the KN currency as $-2/5$, and it is golden-sourced here too: the golden classes contribute $+48$ to the $D_{\mathrm{ad}Q}$ sum and cancel exactly in $D_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}$, the rational-class totals being identical ($-57/4$ each, times $1/120$).
- The factor $4$ here is trigonometric ($\csc^2=4/(2-\chi_Q)$), not the Dynkin index $4$ of Step 1's CS chain; the two fours have different origins and should not be conflated.

*Remark (the defining node).* For $\alpha=Q$ one also has the polynomial identity $\chi_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=\chi_Q^2-1=(2-\chi_Q)(-2-\chi_Q)+3$, whence $D_{\mathrm{ad}Q}-3D_{\mathrm{triv}}=-\tfrac{1}{120}\sum_{g\neq 1}(2+\chi_Q(g))=-\tfrac{59}{30}$: the same number as $\rho^{\mathrm{sign}}_Q(+\Sigma)$. That coincidence is special to the node whose representation angles equal the tangential angles; it fails for $Q'$ ($-131/30$ versus $-71/30$), and the failure gap is exactly $2$.

## 2. Item 2: the KN tautological K-class

KN Proposition 2.2 supplies the canonical tautological extension for each flat $\Gamma$-module: each $\mathcal{R}_i$ carries a canonical finite-action anti-self-dual connection whose flat limit at infinity is $R_i$. So for the flat module $\mathrm{ad}\,Q'=\mathrm{Sym}^2Q'$, the tautological Dirac calculation uses $\mathcal{R}_{d6}$, and the candidate $(A.1)$-type interior term of the Step-2 handoff is the honest one. This closes the K-class for the KN currency used here; if part two instead writes a gauge-deformation complex built from a rank-2 instanton and then takes adjoints, that complex's K-class ($\mathrm{Sym}^2$ of the rank-2 extension, a trace-free endomorphism construction, or a compactly-supported difference) must still be checked separately. (Discharged by part two for the $F$-localized coupling question: any coefficient built on $W$ restricts rank-trivially on the characteristic slot; see [Step 4, part two](step4-coupling.md).) Its charge data, with $k_i:=\int_X(c_2-\tfrac{1}{2}c_1^2)(\mathcal{R}_i)=\mathrm{rk}_i\,D_{\mathrm{triv}}-D_i$:

| bundle | rank | charge $k$ | $k \bmod 1$ | $cs$ of flat limit mod 1 ($+\Sigma$, Step 2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\mathcal{R}_Q$ | 2 | $119/120$ | $119/120$ | $-1/120\equiv 119/120$ |
| $\mathcal{R}_{Q'}$ | 2 | $191/120$ | $71/120$ | $-49/120\equiv 71/120$ |
| $\mathcal{R}_{d2}$ ($\mathrm{ad}Q$) | 3 | $59/30$ | $29/30$ | $4\cdot(-1/120)\equiv 29/30$ |
| $\mathcal{R}_{d6}$ ($\mathrm{ad}Q'$) | 3 | $71/30$ | $11/30$ | $4\cdot(-49/120)\equiv 11/30$ |

**All four satisfy $k\equiv cs \bmod 1$** on $+\Sigma$: the fractional instanton charge of the extension equals the Chern-Simons invariant of its flat limit, across the whole family. This ties Step 2's CS web to the interior Chern-Weil data numerically, in both sectors. Two exact (not just mod-1) echoes, stated with their signs: $k(\mathcal{R}_Q)-k(\mathcal{R}_{Q'})=D_{Q'}-D_Q=-\tfrac{72}{120}=\tfrac{\varepsilon(H)}{\lvert\Gamma\rvert}=-\tfrac{3}{5}$, matching Helle's $cs(Q)-cs(Q')=\varepsilon(H)/\lvert\Gamma\rvert$ from Step 1's Appendix A with the same sign, as an exact identity; and $k(\mathcal{R}_{d6})-k(\mathcal{R}_{d2})=+\tfrac{2}{5}$, the representative of $cs(\mathrm{ad}Q')-cs(\mathrm{ad}Q) \bmod 1$.

## 3. Item 3: the boundary sign convention, pinned

On the compact truncation $W$ with outward normal and $\partial W=+\Sigma$, the APS form used from here on is
$$\mathrm{ind}\,D \;=\;\int_W \hat{A}\,\mathrm{ch}(E)\;-\;\tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(h+\eta\bigr)(\partial W),$$
and the convention is not a choice left open: applying it to the trivial bundle, where KN (A.1) forces the $L^2$-index to vanish and $h=0$ for the boundary Dirac operator on the spherical space form (positive scalar curvature and Lichnerowicz; the ALE interior is scalar-flat, so the vanishing is a boundary statement), yields
$$\eta_{\mathrm{Dir}}(+\Sigma)\;=\;2\,D_{\mathrm{triv}}\;=\;\tfrac{1079}{720},$$
an exact value with the denominator $720$ dividing pattern familiar from equivariant eta computations on this space. Any other sign assignment breaks the (A.1)/(A.2) internal consistency.

*Remark (an independent corroboration).* The APS signature theorem on the truncation, $\mathrm{sign}(W)=\tfrac{1}{3}\int_W p_1-\eta_{\mathrm{Sign}}(\partial W)$, gives $\int_W\hat{A}=-\tfrac{1}{24}\int p_1=-\tfrac{1}{8}\bigl(\mathrm{sign}+\eta_{\mathrm{Sign}}\bigr)=1-\tfrac{361}{1440}=\tfrac{1079}{1440}=D_{\mathrm{triv}}$, using only the signature theorem and the untwisted signature eta of §4, independent of KN. The convention web is therefore triply locked: KN internal consistency, the signature route, and the Ruberman-Saveliev identity below all force the same $\eta_{\mathrm{Dir}}$. (Degeratu's Molien-series formulas agree exactly: her direct group sum, Cor. 2.4 with the half-determinant trivial for $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{SU}(2)$ by her Cor. 3.3, gives $\eta_{\mathrm{Dir},\chi}=+2D_\chi$ at $n=2$ on the boundary-at-infinity orientation, the same convention as here with no sign flip.)

## 4. Item 4: $\bar\mu$, pinned and absorbed into the same currency

In the Neumann normalization $\bar\mu(\Sigma)=\tfrac{1}{8}\bigl(\mathrm{sign}(X)-w\cdot w\bigr)$ (integer-valued, reducing mod 2 to Rokhlin), the even $E_8$ plumbing has Wu class $w=0$, so
$$\bar\mu(\Sigma(2,3,5))=-1,$$
and the $E_8$ filling saturates the Fukumoto-Furuta-Ue bound $b_2(Y)\le -8\bar\mu$ for negative-definite spin fillings ($8\le 8$). Better: Ruberman-Saveliev (arXiv:1009.3201, Thm 1.1) prove, on exactly our orientation (link of the singularity) and geometry,
$$\tfrac{1}{2}\eta_{\mathrm{Dir}}(\Sigma)+\tfrac{1}{8}\eta_{\mathrm{Sign}}(\Sigma)=-\bar\mu(\Sigma).$$
With $\eta_{\mathrm{Dir}}(+\Sigma)=\tfrac{1079}{720}$ from item 3 and the untwisted signature eta computed from the same class data, $\eta_{\mathrm{Sign}}(+\Sigma)=\tfrac{1}{120}\sum_{g\neq 1}\cot^2(\phi_g/2)=\tfrac{361}{180}$:
$$\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot\tfrac{1079}{720}+\tfrac{1}{8}\cdot\tfrac{361}{180}=\tfrac{1079+361}{1440}=1=-\bar\mu \quad\checkmark$$
The check is sharp: of the four sign combinations of the two etas, only the matched pairs give integers ($+,+\Rightarrow 1$ on $+\Sigma$; $-,-\Rightarrow -1$, the $-\Sigma$ statement, consistent with $\bar\mu(-Y)=-\bar\mu(Y)$); the mixed pairs give $\pm 359/720$. So the convention web of items 3 and 4 is over-determined and locks, and $\bar\mu$, the normalizer of the characteristic-slot congruence, is itself an exact combination of the same character sums.

## 5. The unified currency, and the computation this unblocks

Everything the revised Step 4 needs, except one item, is now a closed-form rational in the single currency of character sums on $2I$:

| ingredient | quantity | value on $+\Sigma$ |
|---|---|---|
| A (boundary, Galois) | $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=4\,\Delta D$ | $-8/5$ |
| B (interior, Galois) | charges $k(\mathcal{R}_{d2})$, $k(\mathcal{R}_{d6})$; $\Delta k$ | $59/30$, $71/30$; $2/5$ |
| C (characteristic slot, normalizer) | $\bar\mu$ via $\tfrac12\eta_{\mathrm{Dir}}+\tfrac18\eta_{\mathrm{Sign}}$ | $-1$ |

The one ingredient that is *not* a character sum is the surface itself: the pair $(e(F),\beta(F))$ of an actual characteristic (i.e. $\mathbb{Z}_2$-null) non-orientable surface $F\subset W$, constrained by the congruence menu of Step 3 and normalized by $\bar\mu$ through the with-boundary Guillou-Marin machinery. Step 4's main computation is now precisely posed: determine whether there is an identity in which the boundary Galois asymmetry ($\Delta\rho=-8/5$, equivalently $\Delta D=-2/5$), the interior tautological data ($k(\mathcal{R}_{d6})$, $\mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{R}_{d6})$), and the surface data ($e(F)$, $\beta(F)$, anchored by $\bar\mu=-1$) appear together with nontrivial coefficients, or prove route-specifically that the characteristic slot decouples from the tautological one. That computation, and its verdict either way, is part two.

## Verdict

All four carried items are closed. Item 1 closes as a theorem-grade identity: the odd-signature rho is an affine function of the Dirac-type sums, so the bridge's boundary invariant and the KN index currency are inter-translatable, with the gate value $-8/5$ equal to $4\Delta D$. Item 2 closes for the KN currency used here: the tautological extension is canonical, its charges reproduce the Step-2 Chern-Simons web mod 1 in all four sectors, and the $\varepsilon(H)=-72$ augmentation reappears exactly; the K-class of any gauge-deformation complex part two may write remains its own check. Item 3 is pinned by internal consistency ($\eta_{\mathrm{Dir}}=1079/720$), item 4 by the Neumann normalization ($\bar\mu=-1$) and verified through the Ruberman-Saveliev identity, which lands exactly on $1$ and locks the whole sign web. Part two, the coupling identity itself, is unblocked and precisely posed.
