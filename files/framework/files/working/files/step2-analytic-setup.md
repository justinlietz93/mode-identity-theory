# Step 2 of the postulate bridge: the analytic setup and the sign

**Status (2026-07-01):** Closed. The analytic framework is fixed (ALE instanton on the minimal resolution of $\mathbb{C}^2/2I$, Kronheimer-Nakajima; the orbifold cone is a consistency check only), and the orientation is resolved: on the resolution-boundary orientation $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-8/5$, with the magnitude $73/15$ anchored in print (BHKK). The Step-1 gate conclusion is unchanged; Steps 3-4 (interior coupling) are open.

**Related:** [η-gatekeeper (Step 1)](eta-gatekeeper.md), [Postulate bridge](postulate-bridge.md), [Coexact gap](../../bedrock/files/coexact-gap.md).

**Goal.** Step 1 left two items to the filling. First, the analytic framework: $W$ is simply connected, so the flat $Q'$ on $\partial W$ does not extend flatly, and the extension scheme decides which index formula Steps 3 and 4 write. Second, the sign: the Step-1 difference $8/5$ was computed in a convention whose orientation was deferred. Both are settled here. The framework is the ALE instanton setting of Kronheimer-Nakajima on the minimal resolution, with the orbifold cone as a consistency check rather than a vehicle. The sign: on the resolution-boundary orientation, $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-8/5$; Step 1's $+8/5$ lives on the reversed orientation. The Step-1 gate conclusion (nonzero, Galois-sourced) is orientation-independent and unchanged.

**Convention box (the orientation dictionary).** Write $+\Sigma$ for $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ with its standard orientation. Four descriptions agree: the link of the $E_8$ singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/2I$; the Brieskorn orientation of $\{x^2+y^3+z^5=0\}\cap S^5$; the quotient orientation of $S^3/2I$ from the standard $S^3\subset\mathbb{C}^2$; and the boundary of the minimal resolution $\widetilde{X}\to\mathbb{C}^2/2I$, whose intersection form is the negative definite $E_8$ (eight $(-2)$-curves, the Gompf-Stipsicz "(negative) $E_8$-plumbing"). The Boden-Herald-Kirk-Klassen Poincaré sphere $X_{+1}$ ($+1$ surgery on the right-hand trefoil) is $-\Sigma$: "as oriented manifolds, $X_k\cong-\Sigma(2,q,2qk-1)$" (BHKK, remark after Theorem 6.7, with the Brieskorn sphere carrying "a natural orientation as the link of an algebraic singularity"). Both $cs$ and $\rho$ flip sign under orientation reversal. Consistency across the record: Helle's $cs(Q)=-1/120$ lives on the quotient orientation $+\Sigma$; BHKK's $cs(A_1)=+1/120$ lives on $X_{+1}=-\Sigma$; these are the same statement. Boundary orientations throughout use the outward-normal-first convention; on a compact truncation of the ALE end, the induced boundary orientation of $\widetilde{X}$ is $+\Sigma$ in this convention.

## 1. The framework decision

**The fork.** $\pi_1(W)=1$, so the holonomy $2I\to\mathrm{SU}(2)$ cannot factor through the interior and no flat extension of $Q'$ exists. The two candidate schemes from the bridge note:

- **(A) Cylindrical-end / ALE instanton.** A finite-action anti-self-dual connection on the smooth minimal resolution, asymptotic at infinity to the flat connection on $S^3/2I$. The extension is non-flat and carries instanton charge; the boundary data enter the index formula as finite group sums of exactly the Step-1 defect type.
- **(B) Orbifold cone.** On the orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/2I$ itself the flat connection does extend (the orbifold fundamental group is $2I$), and the index localizes at the cone point.

**Decision: (A) is the vehicle, (B) is a check.** The reason is visible in Nakajima's own pair of formulas. For the ALE space, the dimension of the moduli space of anti-self-dual connections asymptotic to a flat $\rho$ is (Nakajima, Invent. Math. 102 (1990), Theorem (2.7)):

$$\dim M \;=\; \dim G_{\rho} \;-\; \int_X \mathrm{ch}(E^*\otimes E)\,\mathrm{ch}(S^+)\,\hat{A}(X) \;-\; \frac{1}{2\lvert\Gamma\rvert}\sum_{\gamma\neq e} \chi_{\rho}(\gamma^{-1})\,\chi_{\rho}(\gamma)\Bigl(1-\cot\tfrac{r(\gamma)}{2}\cot\tfrac{s(\gamma)}{2}\Bigr),$$

an interior Chern-Weil term plus the boundary group sum. For the orbifold treated equivariantly, the same paper's (2.8) has **no interior class content at all**: the topology term collapses to the charge $2r\int c_2(E)$ and the group sum doubles, one copy at the cone point and one at infinity (with $r_0=r_\infty$, $s_0=-s_\infty$: the two ends see opposite orientations). Route (B) is therefore structurally the Step-1 computation run twice: it sees the local representation data of $\Gamma$ at the cone points, but not the resolved exceptional-curve homology or any non-orientable surface representatives, because the cone has no $H_2$. The moment one resolves to obtain the classes, the flat extension is gone and one is in (A). So (B) survives as a two-cone-point consistency identity, and the bridge program lives in (A).

**What (A) buys Steps 3 and 4.** Kronheimer-Nakajima prove the index machinery in exactly this setting (Math. Ann. 288 (1990), Appendix). Their (A.1), for the twisted Dirac operator on the ALE space with $A$ asymptotic to the flat connection of the $\Gamma$-module $W$:

$$\dim L^2\text{-}\mathrm{Ker}\, D_A^- \;=\; -\int_X \mathrm{ch}(E)\,\hat{A}(X) \;+\; \frac{1}{\lvert\Gamma\rvert}\sum_{\gamma\neq 1} \frac{\chi_W(\gamma)}{2-\chi_Q(\gamma)},$$

and, decisively for us, their (A.2): the tautological bundles $\mathcal{R}_i$ (one per nontrivial irrep of $\Gamma$, each carrying a finite-action anti-self-dual connection) satisfy

$$\int_X \mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{R}_i\otimes\mathcal{R}_j^*)\,\hat{A}(X) \;=\; \frac{1}{\lvert\Gamma\rvert}\sum_{\gamma\neq 1} \frac{\chi_{R_i}(\gamma)\,\chi_{R_j^*}(\gamma)}{2-\chi_Q(\gamma)},$$

where the exceptional curves have intersection matrix $-C_{E_8}$ and the dual tautological $c_1(\mathcal{R}_i)$ classes pair by $-C_{E_8}^{-1}$ (their Theorem A.7). This is the geometric McKay correspondence in index form. It supplies the correct interior basis, the $c_1(\mathcal{R}_i)$ with the distance-six node a definite one of them, and a theorem-level pairing between tautological classes and boundary character sums. What remains for Steps 3 and 4 is to show that the specific surface and normal-twist term the bridge needs lands in this basis with the distance-six coefficient; that is not proved by (A.2), it is set up by it. Note $2-\chi_Q(\gamma)=4\sin^2(\phi_\gamma/2)$: the same golden-class arithmetic as Step 1 sits in the denominators.

**Cost check.** The ALE metric is not the round quotient metric at the boundary, but $\rho$ of a flat connection is metric-independent (APS II, the rho invariant), so the Step-1 boundary values transfer to the ALE end unchanged. Nothing in Step 1 is re-derived or modified by the framework choice; only the sign convention is pinned, next.

## 2. The sign

**The published anchor.** BHKK (arXiv:math/9908020, Section 6) compute the adjoint rho invariant of the first flat connection on the Poincaré sphere, in their orientation $X_{+1}$. Their equation (6.5), for a path $A_t$ from the trivial connection $\Theta$ to a flat $A_1$:

$$SF_{su(2)}(A_t;X) \;=\; 8\bigl(cs(A_1)-cs(A_0)\bigr) \;+\; \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(\varrho_X(\mathrm{ad}\,\alpha_1)-\varrho_X(\mathrm{ad}\,\alpha_0)\bigr) \;+\; \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(\dim H^{0+1}(X;su(2)_{\alpha_1})-\dim H^{0+1}(X;su(2)_{\alpha_0})\bigr),$$

"where the rho invariants are defined relative to the odd signature operator acting on $su(2)$-forms via the adjoint action." They then state: "one can compute that $\varrho_X(\mathrm{ad}\,\alpha_1)=\pm\frac{73}{15}$ by standard methods. The sign ambiguity comes about because the answer depends on how $X$ is oriented. This problem can be resolved since we know that $cs(A_1)=\frac{1}{120}$: the only way the left hand side can be an integer is if $\varrho_X(\mathrm{ad}\,\alpha_1)=\frac{73}{15}$, in which case $SF_{su(2)}(\Theta,A_1;X)=1$."

Two things follow at once. The magnitude $73/15$, which Step 1 computed and could not match to a printed value, **is in print**. And the sign on $X_{+1}$ is $+73/15$, fixed by integrality.

**The same argument for $Q'$, with the lift stated.** With $h(\Theta)=\dim H^{0+1}=3$, $h(\alpha)=0$ (acyclicity), $cs(\Theta)=0$, and $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}}(\Theta)=0$, equation (6.5) reads $SF = 8\,cs + \rho/2 - 3/2$. The magnitude here is Step-1 data: the individual $G$-signature computation gives $\lvert\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}\rvert=97/15$; the integrality equation only chooses the sign. One bookkeeping point: (6.5) uses a real lift of $cs$, and BHKK's Table 1 prints the representative $cs(A_2)=-71/120$, the class of $+49/120$ mod $\mathbb{Z}$. The argument does not depend on the choice: shifting the lift by an integer shifts $8\,cs$ by a multiple of $8$, so both the integrality of $SF$ and its value mod $8$ are lift-independent. Exactly:

- $Q$ ($cs=+1/120$, BHKK's lift): $\rho=+73/15$ gives $SF = \tfrac{2}{30}+\tfrac{73}{30}-\tfrac{45}{30} = 1$ (integer); $\rho=-73/15$ gives $-58/15$ (excluded).
- $Q'$ ($cs=-71/120$, BHKK's printed representative): $\rho=+97/15$ gives $SF = -\tfrac{142}{30}+\tfrac{97}{30}-\tfrac{45}{30} = -3\equiv 5\bmod 8$ (integer); $\rho=-97/15$ gives $-142/15$ (excluded). The $+49/120$ lift gives $SF=5$ directly, the same class mod $8$.

So on $X_{+1}$: $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=+73/15$ (published) and $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}=+97/15$ (forced by the same equation, lift-independently), with spectral flows $1$ and $5$ mod $8$, both odd, as BHKK's parity requirement demands. (A reader consulting their Table 1 will see an $SF(\Theta,A)$ column of zeros: that column records the spectral flow on the knot-complement piece $Z$ of their splitting, which vanishes; the closed-manifold value $SF_{su(2)}(\Theta,A_1;X_{+1})=1$ is stated in their Section 6 text.)

**The machinery identification.** BHKK also print the canonical-representation rho invariants on $X_{+1}$: $\varrho(A_1)=59/30$ and $\varrho(A_2)=131/30$. Running the Step-1 defect machinery (per-element defect $-\cot^2(\phi/2)$, the convention of the eta-gatekeeper note) on the fundamental characters reproduces both printed values exactly, in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt5)$ arithmetic with the surds cancelling. The Step-1 convention **is** the $X_{+1}$ orientation, established against print and independently of the adjoint computation.

**Transfer.** $X_{+1}\cong-\Sigma$ as oriented manifolds, and $\rho$ flips under reversal. On $+\Sigma=\partial\widetilde{X}$, the resolution-boundary orientation:

$$\boxed{\ \rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-\tfrac{73}{15},\qquad \rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}=-\tfrac{97}{15},\qquad \rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-\tfrac{8}{5}\ \text{ on }\partial W\ }$$

**Independent corroborations.**

1. *Direct APS bookkeeping.* Under the quotient orientation of $S^3/\Gamma$ (the APS complex-orientation convention), the orientation-compatible angle assignment gives per-element defect $+\cot^2(\phi/2)$, not $-\cot^2$; the $G$-signature sum then lands on $-8/5$ on $+\Sigma$ directly.
2. *Fintushel-Stern consistency check.* FS (3.8) gives $R(e)=\frac{2e^2}{a}-3+m+\sum_i\frac{2}{a_i}\sum_{k=1}^{a_i-1}\cot\bigl(\tfrac{\pi a k}{a_i^2}\bigr)\cot\bigl(\tfrac{\pi k}{a_i}\bigr)\sin^2\bigl(\tfrac{\pi e k}{a_i}\bigr)$ with $SF(\alpha,\theta)=R(e)\bmod 8$ in their conventions. For $\Sigma(2,3,5)$: $R(1)=1$, $R(7)=5$ exactly (implementation verified against FS's own $\Sigma(4,3,5)$ table: $e=103,109,94,118\to 1,3,5,7$). Run through the grading packages of §3, this is consistent with the negative branch on the Brieskorn orientation and not with the positive one. BHKK carries the sign; this is filed as a consistency check rather than an independent pillar, with the convention chain recorded in the computation notes.
3. *The $cs$ web.* Helle's link-orientation $cs(Q)=-1/120$ and BHKK's $X_{+1}$ value $+1/120$ agree under the flip; and the affine-$E_8$ solve's $cs(Q')=-49/120$ (computed by Helle's method; the value itself is ours) flips to $+49/120$ on $X_{+1}$, the same class mod $\mathbb{Z}$ as BHKK's printed representative $-71/120$.

**What this does to Step 1.** Nothing in the gate changes: the magnitude $8/5$, the golden-class support, and the mod-$\mathbb{Z}$ normalization test are orientation-independent. The deferred sign is now fixed, and the Step-1 caveat "the integer part rests on the $G$-signature computation alone" is retired: $\pm 73/15$ is published (BHKK Section 6), resolved by the same integrality argument used here, and the machinery that produced Step 1 reproduces BHKK's printed canonical-rep values exactly.

## 3. Grading conventions (a reader's guard)

The literature carries three internally consistent grading packages for the same two connections, and mixing them manufactures sign paradoxes. For the record:

Three different quantities travel under the symbol $SF$; they are subscripted here by owner.

| Package | Orientation | Grading of $(Q, Q')$ | Convention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fintushel-Stern 1990 | $+\Sigma$ | $\mu_{\mathrm{FS}}=-R_{\mathrm{FS}}(e)-3=(4,0)$, even | $R_{\mathrm{FS}}(e)=(1,5)$ is FS's rotation-number quantity |
| Modern instanton $I_*$ | $+\Sigma$ | $(1,5)$ | $\mu=-3-SF_{\mathrm{mod}}$ with $SF_{\mathrm{mod}}=(4,0)$ |
| KKR / BHKK | $X_{+1}=-\Sigma$ | $SF_{\mathrm{BHKK}}=(1,5)$ as the grading | $(-\varepsilon,-\varepsilon)$ spectral-flow convention |

The line connecting the last two rows is the reversal identity $SF_{\mathrm{BHKK}}(-\Sigma)=-SF_{\mathrm{mod}}(+\Sigma)-3$ (irreducible, acyclic endpoints): $-(4,0)-3\equiv(1,5)\bmod 8$. The numerical agreement of $R_{\mathrm{FS}}=(1,5)$ on $+\Sigma$ with $SF_{\mathrm{BHKK}}=(1,5)$ on $-\Sigma$ is that identity at work, not the same quantity read twice; mistaking them for equal is precisely the trap this table guards. The familiar $I_*(\Sigma(2,3,5))=\mathbb{Z}_{(1)}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{(5)}$ is the middle row; the assignment $Q\to 1$, $Q'\to 5$ is derived (Helle's grading data plus the reversal rule), stated directly by no single source.

## 4. Handoff to Step 3

Fixed inputs going forward: $W=\widetilde{X}$ (minimal resolution, intersection form negative definite $E_8$), $\partial W=+\Sigma$, boundary data $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-73/15$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}=-97/15$, vehicle formulas KN (A.1)/(A.2) and Nakajima (2.7), interior basis the tautological $c_1(\mathcal{R}_i)$ pairing by $-C_{E_8}^{-1}$ (KN Thm A.7).

The Step-3 target formula, stated so the entry point is actionable: write the APS index of the adjoint-twisted operator on $W$, with the charge-carrying extension asymptotic to $Q'$, as an interior Chern-Weil term in the tautological basis (for the distance-six bundle, the candidate (A.1)-type term $\int_W \mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{R}_{d6})\,\hat{A}$) plus the boundary correction of the flat limit, and determine whether the surface and normal-twist term the bridge needs enters with the distance-six coefficient. Two bookkeeping items belong to that step, not here. First, KN's boundary sums are Dirac-type eta invariants while the bridge's boundary invariant is the odd-signature $\rho$; the formula must either be written for the odd-signature complex or the two etas related explicitly. Second, the sign convention of the boundary correction ($\eta$ versus $-\eta$, outward normal) must be fixed in whichever form is used. The oriented $\rho$ values above are the invariant inputs to both. Step 3 also computes $H_2(W;\mathbb{Z}_2)$, which classes are representable by non-orientable embedded surfaces, and which class the McKay correspondence assigns to the distance-six node.

## Verdict

Step 2 is closed, with the evidentiary weights stated plainly. Framework: the ALE instanton setting on the minimal resolution (Kronheimer-Nakajima); the orbifold cone is a consistency check only, because it lacks the resolved $H_2$ surface-class content Steps 3 and 4 need. Sign: $\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q'}-\rho_{\mathrm{ad}Q}=-8/5$ on the resolution-boundary orientation. The anchors, in order of directness: BHKK's published $+73/15$ for $Q$ on $X_{+1}=-\Sigma$; the same integrality equation forcing $+97/15$ for $Q'$, lift-independently; the machinery identification against BHKK's printed canonical-rep values $59/30$ and $131/30$; and the direct APS orientation bookkeeping, with the Fintushel-Stern package as a consistency check. The $Q$ sign is in print; the $Q'$ sign is forced by a published equation applied to the Step-1 magnitude. Step 1 stands with its digit-match caveat retired. Step 3 is unblocked.
