# Step 4 of the postulate bridge, part two: the coupling identity

**Status (2026-07-01):** Closed; the terminal document of the staged route. The three-ingredient identity degenerates, and the degeneration is proved, not estimated: along every restriction-route formula with the canonical pullback coefficient bundle, the Möbius ingredient couples to the Galois sector with coefficient exactly zero (the triviality lemma: every coefficient built on $W$ restricts rank-trivially to the characteristic slot). The negative is route-specific, per the program's standing standard; the positive residue, the boundary-interior gauge dictionary, survives as theorems. Worksheet: [step4-coupling.test.py](step4-coupling.test.py) (sanity check on the evaluations, not a substitute for the route scoping).

**Goal.** Decide the revised Step-4 question: is there an identity in which the boundary Galois asymmetry ($\Delta\rho=-8/5$, equivalently $\Delta D=-2/5$), the interior tautological distance-six data ($\mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{R}_{d6})$, $k=71/30$), and the characteristic-slot Möbius data ($e(F)$, $\beta(F)$, anchored by $\bar\mu=-1$) all appear with nontrivial coefficients; or does the characteristic slot decouple route-specifically? The answer is the second, and it is now a proof.

**Conventions.** As in parts one and three: $W$ the compact truncation of the ALE resolution, $\partial W=+\Sigma$, curve basis and tautological bundles $\mathcal{R}_i$ with $c_1(\mathcal{R}_j)$ dual to the curves ($\langle c_1(\mathcal{R}_j),[E_i]\rangle=\delta_{ij}$), the characteristic class of $W$ equal to $0$ (Step 3).

## 1. How a surface enters an index formula

The mechanisms on the program's table, by which an embedded surface $F\subset\mathrm{int}\,W$ participates in an index formula, are of one family: pass to the double branched cover $\widetilde{W}\to W$ along $F$ when the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-null condition permits it, or equivalently work on $W\smallsetminus F$ with the appropriate meridian-twisted pin structure; the spin/pin correction along $F$ is exactly the Brown/Guillou-Marin datum, not an additional automatic assumption; then apply an APS-type theorem, equivariantly for the deck involution. In every version the formula splits into three kinds of terms: global interior terms (Chern-Weil integrals of the coefficient bundle over $W$), boundary terms (eta invariants of the flat limit; here $\partial\widetilde{W}$ is two copies of $+\Sigma$, because $2I$ is perfect and $\Sigma$ admits no connected double cover), and **$F$-localized terms** (the Atiyah-Singer $G$-signature/Lefschetz contribution of the fixed set, which is where $e(F)$ and, through the pin refinement, $\beta(F)$ live; the Guillou-Marin congruence is the mod-16 shadow of exactly this localization). The Möbius ingredient enters only through the $F$-localized terms; the Galois ingredient enters the global and boundary terms, as established in part one. The question is whether the $F$-localized terms can carry Galois information when the coefficient bundle is $\mathcal{R}_{d6}$ versus $\mathcal{R}_{d2}$. Call this family of formulas the *restriction route*: every surface contribution is computed from data of the coefficient bundle restricted to $F$ (its characteristic forms and classes on $F$, coupled to the normal-bundle data), with the coefficient bundle carried through as the canonical pullback, whose deck action on fibres over the fixed set is trivial, so the $F$-localized coefficient factor is the ordinary Chern character of $\mathcal{R}|_F$.

## 2. The triviality lemma

**Lemma.** Let $F\subset W$ be a closed non-orientable surface with $[F]_2=0$ (the characteristic slot, the only slot carrying the canonical Guillou-Marin package, by Step 3). Then **every** complex or real vector bundle on $W$, virtual bundles included, restricts to $F$ trivially; in particular every tautological bundle does.

*Proof.* For a closed non-orientable surface, $H^2(F;\mathbb{Q})=0$ and $H^2(F;\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}_2$ (universal coefficients: the $\mathrm{Ext}$ of $H_1$), and the mod-2 reduction $H^2(F;\mathbb{Z})\to H^2(F;\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is injective, with evaluation against the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-fundamental class computing, for a class restricted from $W$, the pairing $\langle c \bmod 2,\ i_*[F]_2\rangle_W$. Since $i_*[F]_2=0$, every class of $W$ restricts to zero in $H^2(F;\mathbb{Z})$ and in $H^2(F;\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Every bundle from $W$ has $w_1=0$ ($H^1(W;\mathbb{Z}_2)=0$), hence is orientable along $F$, and its classifying data over the $2$-complex $F$ (rank and $c_1$ for complex bundles; $w_2$, or the untwisted Euler class in the oriented rank-$2$ case, for real bundles) all live in these two vanishing groups. So every restriction is trivial; virtual bundles follow by additivity. The tautological structure of $\mathcal{R}_i$ enters nowhere. $\square$

*Corollary.* Part one's carried K-class caveat is discharged: any gauge-deformation complex's K-class is a virtual bundle on $W$, and its $F$-localized data on the characteristic slot is rank times trivial, automatically.

Consequently every $F$-localized term of every restriction-route formula depends on the coefficient bundle only through its rank: the rational characteristic data of $\mathcal{R}_i|_F$ vanishes identically (there is no rational $H^2$ to hold it), the torsion and Stiefel-Whitney data vanish on this slot, and Chern-Weil integrands built from the restricted connection integrate over $F$ to exactly these vanishing characteristic numbers. Nothing else about $\mathcal{R}_i$ is visible from $F$.

## 3. The decoupling theorem

**Theorem (route-specific decoupling).** In every restriction-route identity on $W$ using the canonical pullback coefficient bundle, so that the $F$-localized coefficient factor is the ordinary Chern character of $\mathcal{R}|_F$ with the standard (trivial) fibre action over the fixed set, the $F$-localized contribution has the form $\mathrm{rk}(\mathcal{R})\cdot T_F$, where $T_F$ depends only on the surface data ($e(F)$, $\beta(F)$, normal-bundle and pin data) and not on $\mathcal{R}$. Since $\mathrm{rk}(\mathcal{R}_{d6})=\mathrm{rk}(\mathcal{R}_{d2})=3$, the surface term cancels identically from the Galois difference: the coefficient coupling $(e(F),\beta(F))$ to $\Delta\rho=-8/5$ is exactly zero along this route. A formula that inserts an additional nontrivial equivariant fibre action along $F$ is outside this route and would need to be specified separately; none is on the program's table.

The complementary fork closes the other escape:

- On a **root class** (say $[F]_2=x_{d6}$), the restriction is nontrivial ($\langle c_1(\mathcal{R}_{d6}) \bmod 2,\ x_{d6}\rangle=1$: the bundle does couple to the surface), but the canonical Guillou-Marin quadratic enhancement supplied by the ambient characteristic-surface setup is not available there (Step 3): extra choices could decorate such a surface with pin data, but the canonical $W$-tied package, the one the bridge's Möbius ingredient names, does not attach.
- An **orientable** characteristic surface (integral class $2\xi$) pairs integrally with $c_1(\mathcal{R}_{d6})$, but carries the Arf package of the classical Rokhlin story, not the Möbius one: its normal data is orientation-preserving, $w_1(F)=0$, and the band's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ normal twist is exactly what it lacks.

So the two data types occupy channels whose intersection is empty: where the Möbius datum exists, the tautological restriction is trivial; where the tautological restriction is nontrivial, the Möbius datum does not exist. The three-ingredient identity of the revised Step 4 degenerates in every restriction-route formula, and the degeneration is structural, not numerical: it would persist for any $\Gamma$ and any pair of equal-rank tautological bundles.

**Scope of the negative.** This is a statement about the restriction route: formulas whose surface dependence enters through $F$-localized characteristic data of the coefficient bundle. It covers the $G$-signature theorem on branched covers, the Guillou-Marin congruence and its with-boundary refinements, and the twisted-pin-Dirac formulations, which are the mechanisms the staged plan named. It is not a claim that no conceivable invariant links the band to the Galois selection; a coupling would need a mechanism whose surface term sees more of the bundle than its restriction, and no such mechanism is on the program's table.

## 4. The positive residue

What the route proves, rather than fails to prove, is worth stating as the surviving content of the bridge:

- **The gauge dictionary (A and B are coupled, as theorems).** The boundary Galois asymmetry and the interior tautological data determine each other: $\int_X\mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{R}_W)\hat{A}=D_W$ (KN), $\rho^{\mathrm{sign}}_\alpha=\dim\alpha+4(D_\alpha-\dim\alpha\,D_{\mathrm{triv}})$ (part one), $k\equiv cs \bmod 1$ in all four sectors, $\Delta\rho=-8/5=4\Delta D$, $\Delta k=2/5$. The embedding does real work in the gauge sector: the McKay decoration of $W$ carries exactly the boundary's Galois information.
- **The Möbius sector keeps its own identity, Galois-blindly.** For characteristic non-orientable $F\subset W$, the with-boundary Guillou-Marin congruence reads $e(F)+2\beta(F)\equiv\mathrm{sign}(W)-8\mu(\Sigma)\pmod{16}$, with $\mu(\Sigma)=1$ the Rokhlin invariant; since $\mu\equiv\bar\mu\bmod 2$, $8\mu\equiv 8\bar\mu\bmod{16}$, and part one's $\bar\mu=-1$ gives the same landing: $-8-8=-16\equiv 0\pmod{16}$ (calibrated on $B^4$, where the local $\mathbb{RP}^2$ with $e=+2$, $\beta=-1$ gives $0$). Every constant in it ($\mathrm{sign}=-8$, $\mu=1$, $\bar\mu=-1$) is Galois-blind, as Step 3's transitivity theorem requires.
- **No curvature coincidence to check.** Every quantity in both identities is a dimensionless character sum or a surface integer; $2/R^2$ never appears, so the curvature-scale-coincidence check of the staged plan is vacuous here.

## 5. The program verdict

The staged APS/index route terminates here, and the 2026-06-28 expectation (the split) is confirmed at the sharper three-ingredient bar, with both halves now proved rather than expected:

1. **Positive.** Boundary gauge asymmetry and interior McKay/tautological topology are linked by identities: the gate value $-8/5$ is interior-computable, the CS web is charge-realized, and the whole dictionary is exact. This is the theorem the bridge program produces.
2. **Negative, route-specific.** The band's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ normal data cannot be index-coupled to the Galois selection along any restriction-route formula, because on the only slot where that data lives, the tautological bundles are cohomologically invisible. Stated per the standing standard: this route is topological and its surface terms are rank-blind; no claim is made that the two spectra are independent in any universal sense.

For the postulate ($S^1=\partial(\text{Möbius})\hookrightarrow S^3$, $\partial S^3=\emptyset$): the two pieces remain two consequences of one shape, now with a proven boundary-interior dictionary on the gauge side and a proven obstruction telling us where the Möbius piece cannot be attached. The framework never owed this bridge; what it gets instead is sharper: the exact reason the two pillars stand independently along this path, and the exact identities by which the $E_8$ filling remembers the boundary's Galois arithmetic.

## Verdict

Step 4 part two is closed, negative route-specifically and positive where it matters: the coupling coefficient of the Möbius data against the Galois asymmetry is exactly zero in every restriction-route identity (triviality lemma plus equal ranks), the complementary channels are disjoint (root classes couple but carry no Brown package; orientable characteristic surfaces carry Arf, not Möbius, data), and the surviving content is the exact gauge dictionary of part one together with the Galois-blind Guillou-Marin congruence $e+2\beta\equiv 0 \bmod 16$ on $W$. The staged route is complete. The carried gauge-deformation K-class check is discharged for the $F$-localized coupling question: any coefficient built on $W$ restricts rank-trivially on the characteristic slot.
