# :memo: Working Files

Research-in-progress across the framework. Organized by status: an orienting map first, then open problems (foundational upgrades, then technical gaps), then closed results and the data tests run against public datasets, then items gated on external data. Within each section, most important first.

### [Claim Ledger](files/claim-ledger.md)

**Audit lens (2026-06-26):** A skeptical, framework-wide classification of every quantitative claim by epistemic type (forward prediction, zero-freedom structural result, internal theorem, loose comparison, calibration anchor, null result, open problem) and role. Separates the thin forward sector the framework lives or dies on (mostly Euclid DR1) from the retrodictions inside the calibration web, draws the web's eight cycles explicitly, and flags overclaims, double-counts, and the two real internal tensions: Cycle 2 ($\alpha$ is both input and output, so the 0.5% match is a consistency check) and Cycle 7 (the coupling-route and mass-route values of $R$ disagree ~4×). Built to keep the public pages honest, not as the framework's self-description; ends with a source-page triage queue.

**Dependencies:** Indexes the whole framework; see especially [The R Problem](files/r-problem.md) and [Calibration Structure](files/calibration-structure.md).

---

### [The R Problem](files/r-problem.md)

**Tracker:** Maps every route to an independent spatial curvature radius $R$ and where each stands. $\Lambda = 3/R^2$ becomes a forward prediction only with an $R$ not read off $\Lambda$: de Sitter is circular, the Molien gap is not independent, the CMB L-ratio factor of 8 is dead (no topological derivation), and the particle mass spectrum is the one live route (executed, order of magnitude). Includes the shared E₈ / $h = 30$ engine tying the L ratio to the mass formula, and flags the Molien sparse-zone CMB result as the independent survivor of the L work.

**Dependencies:** [R from the mass spectrum](files/r-from-mass-spectrum.md), fermion mass formula, $\Lambda = 3/R^2$ eigenvalue relation.

---

### [The Budget Map](files/budget-map.md)

**Tracker:** The inventory of what is a budget and what is read off one. There is a single conserved budget in this sector, the temporal $\Psi^2 + S^2 = 1$ (with the spatial $u_0^2 + J^2 = 1$ as its twin); temperature ($T \propto 1/S$) and entropy ($\Sigma = k_B \ln W_\text{micro}$) are two readings of its state $S$, not budgets, and the Waltz clock is a map from phase to time. Pins the distinction so the readings are not miscounted as parallel ledgers, the error the entropy note had to fix.

**Dependencies:** [Temporal Budget](files/temporal-budget.md), [Energy as Resolution Amplitude](files/energy-as-resolution-amplitude.md), [Entropy as Realization Budget](files/entropy-as-realization-budget.md).

### [The Postulate Bridge](files/postulate-bridge.md)

**Tracker:** The two bedrock results sit on the two pieces of the postulate $S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3$, and whether a theorem connects them is open. The naive bridge through the shared $2/R^2$ is dead: the surface eigenvalue is $\Gamma$-blind and the Ricci floor is the only $\Gamma$-independent slot in the gap, so the match is a forced curvature-scale coincidence, not a spectral link, and $2I$'s perfectness ($H^1 = 0$) closes the orientation route as well. The one live route is index theory on the $E_8$ plumbing that $S^3/2I$ bounds, where the McKay correspondence identifies the intersection-form $E_8$ with the gauge $E_8$; the gatekeeper is whether the boundary spectral asymmetry distinguishes the Galois connection $Q'$ from $Q$ by the same distance-six anomaly that gives the $36/R^2$ gap. Steps 1 to 3 are done (the gate is open; the framework and sign are fixed; the interior classes are computed and Galois-blind: [η-gatekeeper](files/eta-gatekeeper.md), [Step 2](files/step2-analytic-setup.md), [Step 3](files/step3-interior-classes.md)); the staged route is now complete, as a split: the gauge dictionary is proved (the $E_8$ filling carries the boundary's Galois asymmetry exactly) and the Möbius channel decouples route-specifically ([part one](files/step4-bookkeeping.md), [part two](files/step4-coupling.md)); no universal independence claim is made.

**Dependencies:** [First eigenvalue](../bedrock/files/first-eigenvalue.md), [Coexact gap](../bedrock/files/coexact-gap.md).

### [Scaling Law Uniqueness](files/scaling-law-uniqueness.md)

**Status (two rows forced, factorization argued):** $A/A_P = C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ began as a declared measurement postulate. Two rows are forced: the anti-periodic BC forces $C(\Theta)$'s sinusoidal family and background symmetry (isotropy + orthogonality) selects the first-positive member; units force the integer hierarchy $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ on the dilution sector. The factored form *separates* on a Schur + homothety + Lemma 8 argument within the spectral-boundary observable class, but is not yet closed: independent coordinates do not forbid a cross-term, so the no-cross-term step needs the commutant theorem $A_\text{obs} = A_\Theta \otimes A_\text{spec}$ (the open target). Whether the class exhausts the physical observables is a further premise. Off the form: the $\alpha_W$ twist, the extension *selection* (ground state only), and the $\Omega_H = \Omega_\Lambda$ coincidence.

**Dependencies:** Sector $\mathcal{A}$ eigenvalue, Lemma 8 (spectral inaccessibility), Möbius topology axioms.

---

### [Fibonacci Wells](files/fibonacci-wells.md)

**Status (structurally reduced):** Why the stable sampling positions land at the Fibonacci wells $\{13, 21, 34, 55\}$. The external golden-ratio/Hurwitz route is abandoned (a rounded golden rotation selects a parity class, not the wells). The wells are reframed as the additive continuation of the icosahedral branch orders $(2,3,5)$ on the locked 120-grid, bounded below by the lcm seam ($13$ is the first Fibonacci not dividing $120 = \text{lcm}(1,2,3,5,8)$; divisors tile, non-divisors sample) and above by the antinode reflection $C(k)=C(120-k)$. The residual: define the boundary-native anti-periodic interference functional whose minima are the recurrence positions; the mirror's Lemma 8 rules out any bulk functional (the spectral side is $\Theta$-blind), and $\varphi$ enters internally through the $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt5)$ character field, not Hurwitz.

**Dependencies:** Scaling law uniqueness (phase operator $C(\Theta)$), the-mirror.md (Lemma 8, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt5)$, character ceiling), 120-domain selection.

---

### [Friedmann as Output](files/friedmann-as-output.md)

**Tracker (the half-power clock):** The phase-clock $H(z)$ uses the Friedmann equation as input through exactly one line: the Waltz clock exponent $-1/2$, forced by $S^3$ dimensionality plus GR and empirically unique in its family (integer alternatives ruled out at $\Delta\chi^2 > 60$). Everything else in the chain is axiom, definition, kinematic dictionary ($a \propto S$), or algebra, so the tracker reduces the program to that single exponent, stages the spatial-to-temporal reconciliation as the gatekeeper (the half-angle lap lemma is the cheap first result, and its half is the angle, not the exponent), and enumerates the topologically native clock candidates with the exponent each induces and the gate that lands or kills it. One route lands arithmetically, the self-dual clock under level exchange, whose two faces (the amplitude-level lapse $N^2 = S$ and the geometric mean of the phase and intensity measures) are the same clock; it carries the burden through a three-step gate: the level-exchange involution (closed 2026-07-05 as a qualified yes: [the exchange exists](files/half-power-involution.md) as reciprocity on tick measures anchored by the framework's three sampling levels, and the primitive lands on the proper rate $S^{3/2}$), the tick lemma as decider (next, decomposed into definite-level and exchange-symmetry properties whose unique joint solution is the overlap density $S^{3/2}\,dt$), and a second consequence whose first candidate is committed in advance on the [entropy page](files/entropy-as-realization-budget.md): the realization-rate law $dR \propto S^{3/2}\,dt$, posted before the derivation is attempted. One route is fused with the entropy page's shell-unlock map so a single lemma pays twice, and the stabilizer-ratio reading stays hazard-gated behind the two-3/2s fence. Landing on $-1/2$ is expected under the null (any amplitude/intensity framework carries a square root between levels), so the operator gates carry the entire evidential burden. A route-specific negative across the menu is a recorded outcome: kinematics native, one dynamical import, named.

**Dependencies:** [Temporal budget identity](files/temporal-budget.md), Waltz clock, spatial budget $u_0^2 + J^2 = 1$, Molien shell map (shared with [entropy](files/entropy-as-realization-budget.md)), Gauss-Codazzi embedding (assembly stage only).

---

### [Calibration Structure](files/calibration-structure.md)

**Summary:** Reframes the engine as a calibration scheme: one measured anchor per sector ($H_0$ edge, $\Lambda$ surface, $m_e$ mass-sector normalization), with the topology supplying the exponents, well assignments, and ratios. Localizes the R problem to a single demotion: $\Lambda$ moves from absolute prediction to measured calibration input, and nothing downstream collapses. Draft for a new engine section.

**Dependencies:** a0 paper Appendix A.2, Λ eigenvalue, scaling law.

---

### [Temporal Budget Identity](files/temporal-budget.md)

**Problem:** The phase-clock derivation rests on $\Psi^2 + S^2 = 1$ and the Waltz clock $d\tau/dt = S^{1/2}$, which recovers $\Omega_m = 0.315$ at $\Delta\chi^2 = +0.11$ vs flat ΛCDM. The clock exponent $n = -1/2$ is empirically validated (integer alternatives ruled out at $\Delta\chi^2 > 60$) but not derived from the embedding. The two phase parameterizations ($\Phi$ engine phase and $t$ budget phase) are not yet reconciled.

**Dependencies:** Möbius spatial budget $u_0^2 + J^2 = 1$, Sector $\mathcal{A}$ eigenvalue.

---

### [Cone Point Coherence](files/cone-point-coherence.md)

**Problem:** Galactic coherence (all observers measuring the same $\mathbb{R}^4$) may be the $W$-independence of a nested eigenvalue problem, guaranteed by a cone point at galactic scale. The cone point analysis (Frobenius, Friedrichs, excision) that makes the cosmic eigenvalue well-defined must be re-established at galactic scale with equal rigor. Critical fork: GR tidal curvature in the flat-curve regime is Euler-type with power-law Jacobi solutions that structurally cannot zero; the needed curvature $K_g = \pi^2 a_0^2/v_c^4$ lives at the topology-gravity interface.

**Dependencies:** Sector $\mathcal{A}$ eigenvalue, phase field coherence scale $L_f$, 120-grid scale-free projection.

---

### [Energy as Resolution Amplitude](files/energy-as-resolution-amplitude.md)

**Problem:** $E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$ may be the Pythagorean theorem on the mode decomposition of the sampling operation: temporal-mode amplitude (rest mass) orthogonal to spatial-mode amplitude (momentum). Five promotion steps unwalked: spatial-mode coupling, orthogonality proof, $c^2$ factor from $S^1$ structure, Lorentz recovery as sampling symmetry, connection to mass formula.

**Dependencies:** Standing wave $\Psi = \cos(t/2)$, scaling law, mass formula.

---

### [Redshift and Cooling](files/redshift-and-cooling.md)

**Note:** How a static universe reddens light and cools a bath, both readings of the budget's state $S$. Redshift is the phase ratio $1 + z = S(t_\text{obs})/S(t_\text{emit})$ on the standing wave; cooling is that same ratio on a blackbody, which stays a blackbody at $T \propto 1/S$ (ESTABLISHED as a kinematic equivalence with the FLRW thermal law). Not tired light, not expansion; the distance side rides on the Waltz clock.

**Dependencies:** Temporal budget identity, standing wave $\Psi = \cos(t/2)$, Waltz clock.

---

### [Entropy as Realization Budget](files/entropy-as-realization-budget.md)

**Problem:** A static universe cools by budget transfer $\Psi^2 \to S^2$ ([Redshift and Cooling](files/redshift-and-cooling.md)), but the thermodynamic entropy is unsettled. Candidate: entropy is the spread of the resolution-amplitude budget over realized modes, so the second law is the transfer direction and the low past is forced by $\Psi(0) = +1$. The load-bearing open step is the shell-unlock map $S \mapsto N_\text{max}(S)$ from the $2I$ Molien shells, which sets the accessible-mode count $W_\text{modes}(S)$; entropy is the microstate count over it. Without the map the rising entropy is circular. Scoped to the realization sector, with the gravitational ledger (Penrose) left open.

**Dependencies:** Temporal budget identity, Redshift and Cooling, energy as resolution amplitude, $S^3/2I$ Molien shell spectrum.

---

## :mag_right: Open Gaps

Technical gaps with specific paths forward.

---

**Coupling and scaling exponents.** Each is a distinct single-principle-derivation gap on a gauge or scaling exponent; the load-bearing number stays in place.

- **dist/30 Hierarchy Exponent:** Three convergent paths connect McKay graph distance to the Coxeter number of $E_8$ as the scaling exponent; single-principle derivation open. *Deps:* McKay correspondence, $E_8$ Coxeter number.
- **Scale Consistency:** Three gauge couplings evaluated at different energy scales; $\alpha$ hits 0.5% at low energy but 6.2% at $M_Z$, so the framework must commit to one evaluation scale or derive running from MIT structure. *Deps:* gauge coupling derivation (engine §15), scaling law.
- **$\alpha$ Exponent:** The $\alpha$ exponent equals the minimum grid step; two convergent paths remain and the uniqueness scan confirms, but single-principle derivation is open. *Deps:* grid structure, scaling law.
- **Plato Twist Derivation:** $\cos(\pi/10)$ is motivated by the dodecahedral half-defect and parity violation; the open link is the operator-level mechanism connecting $\mathbb{Z}_2$ holonomy to the multiplicative cosine projection on weak coupling. *Deps:* Möbius non-orientability, stabilizer decomposition.

---

**Selection rules.** Why one structure is picked over its alternative, not yet derived.

- **Grid Ladder Selection Rule:** Three convergent paths connect interaction character to grid resolution ($D = 60$ vs $D = 120$); formal derivation open. *Deps:* stabilizer decomposition, boson/fermion domain split.
- **Anti-periodic BC Selection:** 9/10 assigned fermion masses within ×3; first-principles derivation of why anti-periodic boundary conditions are selected over periodic remains open. *Deps:* Möbius non-orientability, mass formula.

---

**Neutrino sector.**

- **Neutrino Mass Ratios:** $\mu_\Lambda$ as the neutrino floor is motivated; the octave selection and multipliers (4, 22) are identified but not derived from the group theory. *Deps:* mass formula, $\Lambda$ eigenvalue.

---

### [Black Hole Phase Behavior](files/black-hole-phase.md)

**Problem:** $\Phi \to \Theta$ mapping derived at leading order ($C/C_0 = 1 - r_s/r$, $\beta = 1$ forced). Hawking temperature $1/M$ and coefficient derived; thermal character inherited. Area entropy motivated by surface primacy; 1/4 factor not derived. Two-attractor landscape established. Global corrections and quantitative evaporation rate remain open.

**Dependencies:** Sector $\mathcal{A}$ eigenvalue, [Black Double Zero's](../../../cosmos/files/black-hole.md).

---

### [Oort Cloud Project: Nested Coherence Domains](files/oort-cloud-project.md)

**Problem:** Does MIT's structure project into every gravitationally coherent scale, or only the cosmological one? If the 120-grid and 3/2 conversion nest, the Oort Cloud (~144,000 AU) is the solar-system-scale coherence boundary. Central open question: generalizing $L_f = v_c^2/a_0$ from galactic to stellar and planetary scales. Downstream predictions include CMB-ecliptic alignment as a local sampling fingerprint.

**Dependencies:** Sector $\mathcal{A}$ eigenvalue, phase field coherence scale $L_f$, 120-grid scale-free projection, 3/2 Gauss-Codazzi conversion.

---

**Superseded and secondary routes.**

- **240 Alternative for $\alpha_s$:** $C(17/120) \times \Omega^{-1/240}$ sits 1% behind the primary formula, with $240 = 2 \times 120$; requires independent justification or exclusion. *Deps:* grid ladder selection rule, scaling law.
- **$L_\text{strip}/L_\text{fund}$ Ratio:** The factor of 8 has no topological derivation, so this is a dead route to $R$, superseded by the mass spectrum (see [The R Problem](files/r-problem.md)); the only open remnant is the residual ~3% spectral-vs-observational gap (8.17 ± 0.1 vs 7.93).

---

## :white_check_mark: Results

Closed: executed computations and derivations with verdicts in hand.

### [R from the Particle Mass Spectrum](files/r-from-mass-spectrum.md)

**Result (2026-06-15):** Determines the spatial curvature radius $R$ from the fermion mass formula's dependence on the hierarchy factor $\Omega_\Lambda$, independently of $\Lambda$, the CMB, and the de Sitter relation, breaking the R-problem circularity. Electron + muon give $R \sim 20$ Gpc and $\Lambda \sim 8 \times 10^{-54}\,\text{m}^{-2}$, about 14× (one order of magnitude) below the observed value. Precision is capped at order of magnitude by the McKay-lever amplification (60× for $\delta d = 1$) acting on the mass formula's irreducible few-percent residual scatter; a pair scan shows no fermion pair beats electron-muon. The third and only non-excluded route to $R$.

**Dependencies:** Fermion mass formula and torsion table, McKay residual scatter (sets the precision floor), $\Omega_\Lambda$ hierarchy, $\Lambda = 3/R^2$ eigenvalue relation.

---

### [McKay Propagator Correction](files/mckay-propagator-correction.md)

**Resolved, negative (2026-06-06):** No parameter-free propagator or branch-point correction tracks the high-distance mass residuals; the route is closed and the residuals are irreducible scatter at the ~×1.8 level. The standing anomaly: two of twelve SM fermions overshoot at high McKay distance (down ×3.2, top ×3.9), vacuum-dependent (at dist 5, gal misses while triv and std hit within 6%; at dist 7, triv misses while gal hits within 28%), and separately the Coxeter-Galois gate locks all $R_4$ entries to $T_3 = -1/2$, displacing charm.

**Dependencies:** McKay graph for $2I$, $C_\text{geom}$ values for all irreps, torsion table $T^2(\rho \otimes \sigma)$ across vacua, Coxeter-Galois gate.

---

## :file_cabinet: Data Tests

Registered and exploratory tests run against public datasets, with verdicts.

---

### [Phase Field Coherence Scale (SPARC)](files/sparc-phase-field.md)

**Test:** Does $L_f = v_c^2/a_0$ behave as a galactic coherence radius across the SPARC sample, after controlling for ordinary size scaling? Pre-registered pipeline, frozen at tag `v1.0-preregistration` (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20271702), run once against 123 quality-filtered galaxies.

**Result (2026-05-19):** The registered predictions are not borne out. The transition radius tracks $L_f$ with slope ≈ 0.23 (registered [0.7, 1.3]); 53.7% of flat-curve galaxies fall below the closure threshold (registered limit 5%). Verdicts stable across all 27 sensitivity-grid cells. $L_f$ is not the coherence radius the framework posited, and the closure identity does not hold. The lattice arithmetic is untouched.

---

### [H₀ Bimodality (Discrete-vs-Continuous Fork)](files/h0-bimodality-test.md)

**Test:** Do published H₀ measurements cluster into two discrete populations (~67 and ~73), as the Hubble-tension Section V fork predicts, or form a continuous spread? Hartigan dip test, Gaussian mixture, and gap test on 18 compiled measurements (13-row independent subset). Exploratory, not pre-registered.

**Result (2026-05-19):** The discrete two-cluster prediction is not supported. The dip test fails to reject unimodality in every configuration (primary p = 0.217); the Gaussian mixture's 2-component preference is statistically negligible (ΔBIC < 1.2) and points to clusters at 68.4 / 73.2 rather than 67 / 73; the predicted 69-71 gap contains TRGB / CCHP at 69.8. The data sorts by calibration class but does not quantize.

---

## :bar_chart: Waiting on External Data

- **$\nu_2$ Mass:** Predicted at 8.6 meV with a ratio gap of ~7.75× from the nearest entry; JUNO and DUNE are expected to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy and test this value directly. *Deps:* mass formula, neutrino sector assignments.
- **Black Hole Node Distribution on Static $S^3$:** If $S^3$ is static and black holes are topological nodes (double zeros where $\Theta \to 0$ and $\Omega_H \to 0$), their spatial distribution should reflect the symmetry of the 120-cell rather than FLRW comoving evolution; quasar catalogs (Milliquas, SDSS) provide ~900,000 angular positions and redshifts, and the missing piece is the $z$-to-$S^3$-position map (converting redshift to location on the static 3-sphere without assuming spatial expansion), after which supermassive black hole positions can be tested against 120-cell structure. *Deps:* Friedmann as Output (provides the static $S^3$ coordinate system), $z$-to-phase map from temporal budget.
- **Dead Zone:** 8 of 24 mass formula entries are unassigned: 6 in the dead zone ($10^{-9}$ to $10^{-6}$ GeV), 1 target (rank 16, ~349 MeV), 1 excluded (rank 3, ~0.4 eV); the dead zone is probed by sterile neutrino and warm dark matter searches. *Deps:* mass formula, full assignment table.
- **Physical Observation Scale:** $\sqrt{\ell_P \cdot R_\Lambda} \sim 50\,\mu\text{m}$ places the observer at the cellular scale; the geometric midpoint is derived, but the dimensionless derivation connecting this to biological observation is pending. *Deps:* observer position at $\sqrt{\Omega}$, scale hierarchy.
- **Next Cycle Initiation:** What happens at $t = 4\pi$ is outside the current framework; the standing wave completes its period, and whether the cycle repeats, terminates, or transforms is not addressed. *Deps:* none within the current framework.
