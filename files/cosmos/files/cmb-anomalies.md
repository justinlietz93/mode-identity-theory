Four large-angle features in the CMB have persisted across COBE, WMAP, and Planck: a low-ℓ power deficit, an anomalously low quadrupole, an odd-over-even parity preference ($R_{TT} \approx 0.81$), and a quadrupole-octupole alignment (the "axis of evil"). Each is modest (2-3σ), sensitive to the estimator and the mask, broadly consistent with ΛCDM, and still awaiting a polarization counterpart; the interest is less any single feature than the sector that carries the tension. Cosmic topology has long been proposed as a common origin.

This page fixes what the Poincaré homology sphere $S^3/2I$ contributes. Two facts about the manifold hold regardless of cosmology: it is chiral (§III), carrying no orientation-reversing self-isometry, and its $2I$-invariant scalar spectrum has the Molien shell gap (§IV), empty across $N = 2$ to $10$ with its first invariant at $N = 12$. The line the page draws is this: **the topology gives the shell gap, and the open problem is whether the independently read curvature radius $R$ puts that gap at the observed multipoles.** Chirality shuts one route to parity and leaves parity and alignment open to the eigenmode covariance; $R$ is read from the coupling and mass-spectrum routes rather than the CMB (§V).

## I. The four anomalies

At the largest angles ($\ell < 30$), Planck analyses continue to report four features first seen by COBE and WMAP:

- **Low-ℓ deficit.** Less large-angle power than best-fit ΛCDM.
- **Low quadrupole.** $C_2$ low relative to $C_3$ and the higher multipoles.
- **Parity asymmetry.** Odd-ℓ power exceeds even-ℓ at large scales; the Planck TT ratio is $R_{TT} \approx 0.81$ (unity is no preference).
- **Quadrupole-octupole alignment.** The $\ell = 2$ and $\ell = 3$ preferred axes align to within ${\sim}10°$.

Each is 2-3σ on its own, moves with the choice of estimator and mask, sits inside the spread ΛCDM realizations produce, and awaits a confirming signal in polarization. The case rests on their persistence across missions and their shared home at the largest scales, not on any one being decisive.

## II. The manifold

The spatial manifold is $M = S^3/2I$, where $2I$ is the binary icosahedral group of order 120, the largest exceptional finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(2) \cong S^3$. It inherits the round metric of constant positive curvature, has $\pi_1(M) = 2I$ and $b_1 = 0$, and is orientable as a three-manifold. As the Poincaré homology sphere $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ it is chiral (§III). The Möbius surface of the broader framework is the source of the cosmological-constant eigenvalue, separate from the CMB spectrum. The curvature radius $R$ enters the harmonic spectrum (§IV); its value is the open problem of §V.

## III. Chirality theorem

The structural result is that $S^3/2I$ is chiral.

Every orientation-reversing isometry of $S^3$ has the form $q \mapsto u\,\bar{q}\,v$ in quaternion coordinates (conjugation reverses order). Since $2I$ acts by left multiplication, any such map turns that left action into a right one, and for a non-central element a left translation stays distinct from a right one. So $S^3/2I$ admits no orientation-reversing self-isometry: it is chiral. This matches the known property of $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ and the general fact that every closed three-dimensional spherical space form is orientable.

What this closes is one route to parity. An even/odd-ℓ grading driven by an orientation-reversing identification, a Möbius boundary condition of the kind earlier versions of this page invoked, would need exactly the self-isometry the theorem rules out; that grading route is shut, and the $2I$-invariant spectrum inherits no intrinsic parity selector from it. Parity itself stays open: a compact quotient can still carry parity-odd and aligned structure through the anisotropic covariance of its eigenmodes, a route cosmic-topology work has established in general (the COMPACT collaboration among them), where the covariance produces parity-odd correlations without parity-violating microphysics. The $S^3/2I$ channel specifically is the open calculation. So the parity asymmetry and the quadrupole-octupole alignment remain open to this topology, pending that calculation, rather than being assigned to it or removed from it.

## IV. The Molien shell gap

Scalar harmonics on $S^3$ are graded by polynomial degree $N = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ with eigenvalue $N(N+2)/R^2$ and degeneracy $(N+1)^2$. On $S^3/2I$ only $2I$-invariant harmonics survive; the centre $\{-1\}$ acts on degree $N$ by $(-1)^N$, restricting invariants to even $N$. Among these the Molien series of the invariant ring is

$$P(t) = \frac{1 - t^{60}}{(1 - t^{12})(1 - t^{20})(1 - t^{30})},$$

with generators at degrees 12, 20, and 30 (the three Klein icosahedral invariants). The first nontrivial invariant is at $N = 12$; the shells $N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10$ are empty, and the surviving shells run $N = 0, 12, 20, 24, 30, \ldots$. This shell structure is topological and fixed, a spectral fact about $S^3/2I$ that holds independent of cosmology.

Where the gap lands on the sky depends on $R$. Each shell maps to a characteristic multipole $\ell_\mathrm{char}(N) = \sqrt{N(N+2)}\,\chi_*/R$, with $\chi_*$ the comoving distance to last scattering, so the boundary set by the last empty shell ($N = 10$) scales as $1/R$: it falls near $\ell \approx 28$ at the de Sitter scale $R \approx 5.3$ Gpc and near $\ell \approx 8$ at the mass-spectrum scale $R \approx 20$ Gpc. The reach of the deficit into the observed range ($\ell \lesssim 30$) therefore rides on $R$, and the two independent routes pull opposite ways: the observed suppression prefers the smaller radius, the mass spectrum points higher. The low quadrupole sits inside this same thinning; its $C_2/C_3$ value waits on the full projection (transfer functions, primordial weighting, observer position), held apart from the shell-gap result.

## V. The curvature scale

The shell structure of §IV is fixed; what $R$ sets is where it lands, and $R$ is the framework's open problem rather than something the CMB supplies.

The operative cosmology is flat FLRW and CMB-consistent: spatial curvature enters as a static boundary condition rather than a Friedmann term, so the apparent $\Omega_K$ is zero and light propagates on flat-equivalent distances $D_M = \chi_*$. An earlier version of this analysis read $R$ off the deficit boundary, took it as a physical spatial-curvature radius, and applied the curved projection $D_M = R\sin(\chi/R)$, which moved the first acoustic peak to $\ell \approx 42$ and implied $\Omega_\mathrm{tot} \approx 1.70$; that step was a coordinate error, since the flat-FLRW distance relation leaves the acoustic scale and $\Omega_\mathrm{tot}$ at their measured values.

So the Molien gap fixes the shell structure, and $R$ fixes where that structure lands. Two independent routes read $R$, and they read it differently. The coupling ($\alpha$) route fixes $\Omega_\Lambda$, hence $\Lambda$ to about 24% and $R$ near 5.3 Gpc, which lands the gap in the observed band. The mass spectrum gives an order-of-magnitude reading near 20 Gpc, which lands it near $\ell \approx 8$, below the band. That split, the well-conditioned route placing the deficit in range and the rough one below, is the open problem (tracked in [the R problem](../../framework/files/working/files/r-problem.md)). The hinge is falsifiable: the deficit must appear where the independently read $R$ puts it.

## VI. Matched circles

A compact quotient can produce matched circles where the last-scattering sphere meets its topological copies. Planck's searches returned a null over the topology classes and circle statistics tested, which constrains standard compact FLRW geometries whose fundamental domain reaches the last-scattering surface. This framework uses the topology as a global boundary condition while keeping CMB propagation flat-FLRW, so the standard curved-space circle exclusion describes a different geometry than the one here. The model therefore owes its own circle prediction, computed from the same $R$, transfer functions, and boundary prescription that set the low-ℓ spectrum. Until that calculation runs, the matched-circle null stays a consistency check, sitting to one side of both support and exclusion.

## VII. Falsification

| Claim | Falsified if |
|---|---|
| $S^3/2I$ is chiral | An orientation-reversing self-isometry of $S^3/2I$ is exhibited |
| The orientation-reversing grading route to parity is shut | A parity grading is derived from that route on the orientable quotient |
| Molien shell gap: first invariant at $N = 12$, shells 2-10 empty | A $2I$-invariant harmonic appears at $N = 2, 4, 6, 8$, or $10$ |
| The deficit lands at the observed multipoles | The independently read $R$ places the cutoff outside the observed $\ell \lesssim 30$ band |

---

The accounting is the result. Two facts about $S^3/2I$ hold independent of cosmology: it is chiral, and its $2I$-invariant scalar spectrum carries the Molien gap across $N = 2$ to $10$. From there the four anomalies sort. The low-ℓ deficit, with the low quadrupole inside it, is the shell gap, and whether it reaches the observed multipoles rides on the independently read $R$: the coupling route, the better-conditioned one, places the last empty shell near $\ell \approx 28$ and lands the deficit in band; the mass-spectrum route, an order-of-magnitude reading, places it near $\ell \approx 8$, below the band. The parity asymmetry and the quadrupole-octupole alignment stay open to this topology through the eigenmode covariance, a calculation still to run. The matched-circle null stays a consistency check, pending the framework's own circle prediction. And the curvature radius is the open problem, read from the coupling and mass-spectrum routes rather than the CMB.

*The shell gap is the topology's to give; whether it lands where the data sees it is for $R$ to settle.*
