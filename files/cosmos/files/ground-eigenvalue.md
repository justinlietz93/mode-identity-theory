# Ground Eigenvalue of the Twisted Laplacian on a Totally Geodesic Möbius Band in S³ in the Reduced Anti-Periodic Sector

[![Ground mode eigenvalue](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1AZfOvcrIdk/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZfOvcrIdk)

We study the ground eigenvalue of the twisted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the Möbius band embedded totally geodesically in $S^3$, in Sector $\mathcal{A}$ (the reduced $w$-constant admissible regular-branch anti-periodic sector, defined precisely in Section 2). The embedding induces the metric $ds^2 = dy^2 + \cos^2(y/R)\,dw^2$, which carries constant Gaussian curvature $K = 1/R^2$, with the metric degenerating at the interior cone point $y = \pi R/2$. The problem is posed as a regular-branch Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem on two smooth half-intervals with continuity at the cone point.

Two independent paths establish that the ground eigenvalue equals the surface scalar curvature exactly: $\lambda_0 = R_\Sigma = 2/R^2$. The upper bound follows from a direct eigenfunction computation with explicit Rayleigh quotient. The lower bound follows from the Bochner identity, with boundary flux vanishing because the boundary curves $w = \pm W$ are geodesics of the surface. Both bounds are established via cone point excision: near $y = \pi R/2$ the regular-branch eigenfunction satisfies $u' = O(\delta)$, so the excision boundary contributions vanish as $O(\epsilon^2)$.

The flat strip gives $\lambda_0 = 1/R^2 = R_\Sigma/2$. The totally geodesic embedding in $S^3$ supplies the missing factor of 2 through the induced curvature. To the authors' knowledge this specific model has not received prior treatment.

## 1. Introduction

The spectral geometry of non-orientable surfaces has been studied extensively in the closed case. The Lichnerowicz bound $\lambda_1 \geq R_\Sigma$ for the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on closed Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature is classical, and the Obata theorem characterizes the equality case. For the closed non-orientable surface $\mathbb{RP}^2 = S^2/\{\pm 1\}$, the twisted Laplacian acting on functions satisfying anti-periodic boundary conditions under the deck transformation has ground eigenvalue $\lambda_0 = 2/R^2 = R_\Sigma$, recoverable from the odd spherical harmonics at $\ell = 1$ (Chavel 1984, Ch. 3).

The open case has seemingly not received the same treatment. The Möbius band is the canonical non-orientable surface with boundary. Its twisted Laplacian on the flat strip is well understood, with ground eigenvalue $\lambda_0 = \pi^2/L^2$ in the anti-periodic sector. Curved Möbius band spectral theory has been studied by Kalvoda, Krejčiřík, and Zahradová (2020) for strips embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with non-constant curvature in the thin-strip limit. The present model differs: the embedding is totally geodesic in $S^3$, the curvature is constant at $K = 1/R^2$, and the computation yields an exact ground eigenvalue rather than an asymptotic.

The problem is posed as a regular-branch Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem on two smooth half-intervals with continuity at the cone point, where the metric degenerates. Reilly (1977) extends the Lichnerowicz bound to compact manifolds with convex boundary via a Hessian operator argument; Escobar (1990) establishes sharp Neumann eigenvalue bounds on manifolds with boundary under Ricci and boundary curvature conditions. The totally geodesic boundary case, where the second fundamental form vanishes, is the cleanest instance of that framework. The present paper follows Reilly's method -- integrating the Bochner formula and controlling the boundary term -- adapted to this singular model via cone point excision.

We offer a proof that, in Sector $\mathcal{A}$, the lowest eigenvalue satisfies:

$$\lambda_0 = R_\Sigma = \frac{2}{R^2}$$

The flat strip yields $\lambda_0 = 1/R^2 = R_\Sigma/2$. The totally geodesic embedding in $S^3$ supplies the missing factor of 2 through the induced constant curvature. Two independent paths establish this identity. Section 5 provides direct computation via the ground eigenfunction $\sin(y/R)$ with explicit Rayleigh quotient upper bound. Section 6 provides a Bochner identity argument yielding the lower bound independently. The two bounds meet at equality in Section 7.

## 2. Setup

Let $C \subset S^2_R$ be a reference great circle. For each $w \in [-W, W]$, let $\gamma_w$ denote the meridional geodesic orthogonal to $C$ at the point of $C$ with arclength parameter $w$. The strip

$$\widetilde{M} = \{(y, w) : 0 \leq y \leq \pi R,\; -W \leq w \leq W\}$$

carries the metric $ds^2 = dy^2 + \cos^2(y/R)\,dw^2$ (derived in Section 4 from the totally geodesic embedding in $S^3$), where $y$ is arclength along each meridian and $w$ labels meridians by arclength along $C$. Its boundary components are the curves $w = \pm W$. The Möbius band $M$ is obtained by the twisted identification

$$(0, w) \sim (\pi R, -w)$$

equivalently, on the meridional cover, $(y + \pi R, w) \sim (y, -w)$. Traversing the meridional direction once returns a field to the opposite transverse edge; a second traversal returns to the start. The boundary $\partial M = S^1$ is a single closed loop traversing the band twice.

**The problem studied in this paper.** We study one specific eigenvalue problem: the twisted Laplace-Beltrami operator on this surface in Sector $\mathcal{A}$, with the metric induced by the totally geodesic embedding in $S^3$ derived in Section 4. The problem is stated as a regular-branch Sturm-Liouville problem on two half-intervals with an interior transmission condition at the cone point $y = \pi R/2$.

A function $u$ is *admissible* if:

- $u$ is $C^2$ on each of $(0, \pi R/2)$ and $(\pi R/2, \pi R)$
- $u$ is continuous at $y = \pi R/2$
- $u(\pi R) = -u(0)$ &emsp; (anti-periodic condition)

The eigenvalue problem is: find $\lambda > 0$ and admissible $u \not\equiv 0$ satisfying

$$-\Delta_g\, u = \lambda\, u \qquad \text{on each smooth piece}$$

where $\Delta_g u = u'' - R^{-1}\tan(y/R)\,u'$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the metric $ds^2 = dy^2 + \cos^2(y/R)\,dw^2$. We refer to this as **Sector $\mathcal{A}$**: the reduced $w$-constant admissible regular-branch anti-periodic sector.

**The cone point.** At $y = \pi R/2$ the metric coefficient $\cos(y/R)$ vanishes. This is the pole of the totally geodesic $S^2$. The Gaussian curvature $K = 1/R^2$ extends continuously to the cone point on the smooth locus, and the excision argument of Section 6 treats the metric degeneration regardless of cone angle. The continuity condition at $y = \pi R/2$ selects the regular branch of the local solution. The cone point is where the antinode of the standing wave sits: the ground eigenfunction $u_0 = \sin(y/R)$ takes its maximum value 1 there with $u_0' = 0$.

**Boundary conditions.** The Möbius identification imposes the longitudinal condition directly and the transverse edges are taken as free:

- *Longitudinal (anti-periodic):* $\psi(y + \pi R, w) = -\psi(y, -w)$, imposed by the Möbius identification.
- *Transverse (Neumann):* $\partial_w \psi\big|_{w = \pm W} = 0$, free boundary at the transverse edges.

**Scope.** This paper establishes the ground eigenvalue in Sector $\mathcal{A}$. Section 5 exhibits the explicit ground eigenfunction. Section 6 establishes the lower bound. Section 7 combines them. Sector $\mathcal{A}$ is the physically and geometrically motivated sector: it is where isotropic modes live, and the paper proves the eigenvalue in that sector. As a heuristic, the $w$-eigenfunctions on $[-W, W]$ with Neumann conditions are $\cos(n\pi w/W)$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$; any $n \geq 1$ mode adds a strictly positive contribution to the eigenvalue, so the $w$-constant ($n = 0$) sector contains the lowest eigenvalue among all separable modes. Whether the full 2D operator's ground state coincides with the Sector $\mathcal{A}$ result is not addressed here.

**The cone point and the limit-circle condition.** The singular endpoint $y = \pi R/2$ is of limit-circle type in the Sturm-Liouville classification: both the regular branch $u \sim 1$ and the logarithmic branch $u \sim \log|\delta|$ are square-integrable with respect to $|\cos(y/R)|\,dy$ near the cone point. The continuity condition at $y = \pi R/2$ excludes the logarithmic branch, which is unbounded there, and selects the bounded regular branch studied here. Derivative matching at the cone point is then automatic: in the regular branch, $u' = O(\delta) \to 0$ as $\delta \to 0$, so $u'(\pi R/2) = 0$ from each side, and the eigenvalue equation on each half-interval determines this behavior from the equation itself with no need to impose it separately.

## 3. The Flat Strip Baseline

On the flat strip, the metric is Euclidean: $ds^2 = dy^2 + dw^2$. The Laplace-Beltrami operator reduces to the standard Laplacian $\Delta = \partial_y^2 + \partial_w^2$. In the anti-periodic sector with $\psi$ constant in $w$, the eigenproblem reduces to:

$$-\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = \lambda\, u, \qquad u(y + L) = -u(y)$$

The general solution is $u \propto e^{iky}$. The anti-periodic condition requires $e^{ikL} = -1$, satisfied when $kL = (2m+1)\pi$ for integer $m$. The ground mode is $m = 0$, giving $k = \pi/L$ and:

$$\lambda_0^{\text{flat}} = \frac{\pi^2}{L^2}$$

**Fixing $L$ from the boundary.** The boundary $\partial M = S^1$ is embedded as a great circle of $S^3$ of radius $R$. Its circumference is $2\pi R$. The Möbius identification $(y + L, w) \sim (y, -w)$ means a path traversing the meridional direction once arrives at the opposite transverse edge, not the starting point; a second traversal is required to return to the start, so the boundary loop has length $2L$:

$$2L = 2\pi R \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad L = \pi R$$

Substituting:

$$\lambda_0^{\text{flat}} = \frac{\pi^2}{(\pi R)^2} = \frac{1}{R^2}$$

The scalar curvature of a constant-curvature surface with $K = 1/R^2$ is $R_\Sigma = 2K = 2/R^2$. The flat strip therefore yields:

$$\lambda_0^{\text{flat}} = \frac{1}{R^2} = \frac{R_\Sigma}{2}$$

The totally geodesic embedding in $S^3$ supplies the missing factor of 2 as developed in Section 4.

## 4. Totally Geodesic Embedding in S³

A submanifold is totally geodesic if its extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes identically: $K_{ij} = 0$. Geodesics of the submanifold are geodesics of the ambient manifold. Any curvature the submanifold carries is inherited entirely from the ambient space. Throughout this section, $K_{ij}$ denotes the extrinsic curvature (second fundamental form) of the surface in $S^3$, while $K$ denotes the intrinsic Gaussian curvature of the surface.

**The embedding.** Realize $S^3$ as the simply connected closed 3-manifold of constant sectional curvature $1/R^2$. The great $S^2 \subset S^3$ is a totally geodesic 2-sphere. The Möbius band $M$ is the quotient of the spherical band $\widetilde{M}$ defined in Section 2, embedded in this $S^2$. Every geodesic of the equatorial $S^2 \subset S^3$ is a great circle of $S^2$, hence also a great circle of $S^3$, and therefore a geodesic of $S^3$. This is the direct reason that $S^2 \subset S^3$ is totally geodesic, so its second fundamental form vanishes: $K_{ij} = 0$. The Möbius identification is the restriction of an isometry of $S^3$ that restricts to the antipodal map on $S^2$ to the equatorial belt:

$$(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \mapsto (-x_1, -x_2, -x_3, x_4)$$

an ambient isometry that preserves $S^2$ setwise and preserves its normal line field. We therefore pass from the spherical band to the Möbius band by imposing the twisted identification from Section 2, $(y + \pi R, w) \sim (y, -w)$. Accordingly, away from the cone point $y = \pi R/2$, the Möbius band is locally modeled on $S^2$ and remains locally totally geodesic. Its boundary consists of the two curves $w = \pm W$, which together form a single closed loop $\partial M = S^1$ traversing the band twice.

**The induced metric.** Because $S^2 \subset S^3$ is totally geodesic, its intrinsic metric equals the restriction of the ambient metric and intrinsic geodesics coincide with ambient geodesics. The following calculation is therefore intrinsic to $S^2(R)$. In Fermi coordinates on the totally geodesic $S^2 \subset S^3$, let $w$ denote arclength along a reference great circle and let $y$ denote arc-length parameter along a meridional geodesic of $S^2$, with $y = 0$ at the reference great circle. The normal Jacobi field satisfies

$$J'' + \frac{1}{R^2}J = 0, \qquad J(0) = 1, \quad J'(0) = 0$$

so $J(y) = \cos(y/R)$. Hence the induced metric is $ds^2 = dy^2 + \cos^2(y/R)\,dw^2$, with $\cos(y/R)$ vanishing at $y = \pi R/2$. The associated Riemannian density is therefore $|\cos(y/R)|\,dy\,dw$. The parameter $y$ runs from $0$ to $\pi R$, passing through the pole at $y = \pi R/2$ and reaching the antipodal great circle at $y = \pi R$.

**The cone singularity.** At $y = \pi R/2$, the metric coefficient $g_{ww} = \cos^2(y/R)$ vanishes, so all points at that longitude are metrically identified. The transverse interval collapses to a single point in the metric sense. The Gaussian curvature $K = 1/R^2$ extends continuously to the cone point on the smooth locus. The cone point is handled in Sections 5 and 6 by excision: the regular-branch eigenfunction satisfies $u' = O(\delta)$ near the cone point, so the excision boundary contributions vanish as $O(\epsilon^2)$ and the Bochner and Green identities remain valid for admissible eigenfunctions despite the metric degeneration.

**The width parameter.** The band has transverse half-width $W \in (0, \pi R)$. At $W = \pi R$ the boundary vanishes and the band closes to $\mathbb{RP}^2$. The eigenvalue $\lambda_0 = 2/R^2$ is independent of $W$: it appears in neither the Rayleigh quotient ratio nor the Bochner bound, both of which involve $W$ only through overall factors that cancel. The cone angle at $y = \pi R/2$ is $2W/R$, which equals $2\pi$ only when $W = \pi R$; for smaller $W$ the cone point carries a genuine angular deficit, but the excision argument of Section 6 is valid for any cone angle.

**Curvature.** For a metric of the form $ds^2 = dy^2 + f(y)^2\,dw^2$, the Gaussian curvature is $K = -f''/f$. With $f(y) = \cos(y/R)$:

$$f'' = -\frac{1}{R^2}\cos(y/R) \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad K = -\frac{f''}{f} = \frac{1}{R^2}$$

The intrinsic scalar curvature is:

$$R_\Sigma = 2K = \frac{2}{R^2}$$

This is the curvature the flat strip does not carry. The embedding in $S^3$ supplies it through the totally geodesic condition. The Laplace-Beltrami operator on this metric is the object of Sections 5 and 6.

## 5. Direct Computation and Upper Bound

For the metric $ds^2 = dy^2 + \cos^2(y/R)\,dw^2$ with $f(y) = \cos(y/R)$, the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on $y$-dependent functions in the anti-periodic sector is:

$$\Delta u = u'' + \frac{f'}{f}\,u' = u'' - \frac{1}{R}\tan(y/R)\cdot u'$$

**The ground eigenfunction.** We test $u_0 = \sin(y/R)$. Computing the derivatives:

$$u_0' = \frac{1}{R}\cos(y/R), \qquad u_0'' = -\frac{1}{R^2}\sin(y/R)$$

Substituting into the operator:

$$\Delta u_0 = -\frac{1}{R^2}\sin(y/R) - \frac{1}{R}\tan(y/R)\cdot\frac{1}{R}\cos(y/R)$$

$$= -\frac{1}{R^2}\sin(y/R) - \frac{1}{R^2}\sin(y/R)$$

$$-\Delta u_0 = \frac{2}{R^2}\sin(y/R) = \frac{2}{R^2}\,u_0$$

The eigenvalue for this eigenfunction is $2/R^2$.

**Anti-periodic boundary condition.** Verifying directly:

$$u_0(y + \pi R) = \sin\!\left(\frac{y + \pi R}{R}\right) = \sin\!\left(\frac{y}{R} + \pi\right) = -\sin\!\left(\frac{y}{R}\right) = -u_0(y) \quad \checkmark$$

**Rayleigh quotient upper bound.** The area element is $dA = |\cos(y/R)|\,dy\,dw$, using the unsigned expression since $\cos(y/R) < 0$ for $y \in (\pi R/2, \pi R)$. With $\nabla u_0 = (1/R)\cos(y/R)\,\partial_y$ and $g_{yy} = 1$:

$$|\nabla u_0|^2 = \frac{\cos^2(y/R)}{R^2}$$

Substituting $t = y/R$:

$$\int_M |\nabla u_0|^2\,dA = \frac{2W}{R^2}\int_0^{\pi R}|\cos(y/R)|^3\,dy = \frac{2W}{R^2}\cdot 2R\int_0^{\pi/2}\cos^3 t\,dt = \frac{2W}{R^2}\cdot\frac{4R}{3} = \frac{8W}{3R}$$

$$\int_M u_0^2\,dA = 2W\int_0^{\pi R}\sin^2(y/R)|\cos(y/R)|\,dy = 2W\cdot 2R\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^2 t\cos t\,dt = 2W\cdot\frac{2R}{3} = \frac{4WR}{3}$$

The Rayleigh quotient gives:

$$\lambda_0 \leq \frac{\int_M |\nabla u_0|^2\,dA}{\int_M u_0^2\,dA} = \frac{8W/3R}{4WR/3} = \frac{2}{R^2}$$

The lower bound is established in Section 6.

---

## 6. Bochner Lower Bound

Section 5 established $\lambda_0 \leq 2/R^2$ via direct computation. This section establishes the lower bound independently, without reference to any test function.

**Non-orientability.** The Möbius band is non-orientable, but the divergence theorem is applied here via the Riemannian density $|\cos(y/R)|\,dy\,dw$, which is a positive measure well-defined on any Riemannian manifold without requiring an orientation. The orientability obstruction to integrating differential forms does not apply to integration against a positive density.

The Bochner argument is applied entirely within Sector $\mathcal{A}$. All subsequent analysis assumes $u = u(y)$ admissible in the sense of Section 2.

Let $u$ be any admissible eigenfunction in Sector $\mathcal{A}$ with $-\Delta_g u = \lambda u$ and Neumann boundary condition $\partial_\nu u\big|_{\partial M} = 0$. Apply the Bochner formula in dimension 2:

$$\frac{1}{2}\Delta|\nabla u|^2 = |\nabla^2 u|^2 + \text{Ric}(\nabla u, \nabla u) + \langle \nabla u, \nabla \Delta u \rangle$$

On a 2-dimensional surface with $\text{Ric} = Kg$ where $K = 1/R^2$, substituting $\nabla \Delta u = -\lambda \nabla u$:

$$\frac{1}{2}\Delta|\nabla u|^2 = |\nabla^2 u|^2 + K|\nabla u|^2 - \lambda|\nabla u|^2$$

**Cone point excision.** The Bochner formula is applied on the smooth manifold $M_\epsilon = M \setminus \{|y - \pi R/2| < \epsilon\}$. This introduces two additional boundary curves $y = \pi R/2 \pm \epsilon$. On each smooth side of the cone point, writing $\delta = y - \pi R/2$, the reduced eigenequation is

$$(|\cos(y/R)|\,u')' + \lambda|\cos(y/R)|\,u = 0$$

with $|\cos(y/R)| \sim |\delta|/R$ near $\delta = 0$. The corresponding local solutions are a regular branch $u \sim 1$, for which $u' = O(\delta)$, and a logarithmic branch $u \sim \log|\delta|$, for which $u' \sim 1/\delta$. The logarithmic branch satisfies

$$\int (u')^2|\cos|\,d\delta \sim \int \delta^{-1}\,d\delta = \infty$$

and is therefore excluded from the admissible class by the continuity condition at the cone point. Hence eigenfunctions lie in the regular branch and satisfy $u' = O(\delta)$ (Zettl 2005, Ch. 4). Near the cone point $\tan(y/R) \sim R/\delta$, but since $u' = O(\delta)$, the product $R^{-1}\tan(y/R)\cdot u' = O(1)$, so the eigenequation $u'' = -\lambda u + R^{-1}\tan(y/R)\cdot u'$ gives $u'' = O(1)$. In the $w$-constant sector, $|\nabla u|^2 = (u')^2$ and $\nu = \pm\partial_y$ on the excision curves, so

$$\partial_\nu|\nabla u|^2 = 2u'u'' = O(\epsilon)$$

The arclength element along $y = \pi R/2 \pm \epsilon$ is $ds = |\cos(y/R)|\,dw \sim (\epsilon/R)\,dw$, so each excision curve has length $O(\epsilon)$. Therefore

$$\left|\int_{\{y = \pi R/2 \pm \epsilon\}} \partial_\nu|\nabla u|^2\,ds\right| = O(\epsilon^2) \to 0$$

The divergence theorem on $M_\epsilon$ passes to the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ with no contribution from the excision boundaries.

$$\frac{1}{2}\int_M \Delta|\nabla u|^2\,dA = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial M} \partial_\nu|\nabla u|^2\,ds$$

**Boundary flux vanishing.** The Neumann condition $\partial_\nu u = 0$ makes $\nabla u$ tangential on $\partial M$, so the flux reduces to $2\nabla^2 u(\nu, T)\cdot \partial_T u$ where $T$ is the unit tangent to $\partial M$. Specifically, $T(\nu u) = 0$ since $\nu u = 0$ holds everywhere on $\partial M$ by Neumann, and $\nabla_T \nu = -\kappa_g T$ by the Frenet formula, giving $\nabla^2 u(\nu, T) = \kappa_g\,\partial_T u$ where $\kappa_g$ is the geodesic curvature of $\partial M$ within the surface. The boundary curves $w = \pm W$ are $y$-parametrized with:

$$\nabla_{\partial_y}\partial_y = \Gamma^w_{yy}\partial_w = 0$$

since $g_{yy} = 1$ is constant and $g_{yw} = 0$. Therefore $\kappa_g = 0$ and the boundary flux is identically zero.

**Green's identity at the cone point.** The identity $\int_M|\nabla u|^2\,dA = \lambda\int_M u^2\,dA$ follows from Green's identity with Neumann BC. The same cone-point excision applies: the boundary contribution is $|u\,\partial_\nu u|\cdot\text{arc-length} = O(1)\cdot O(\epsilon)\cdot O(\epsilon) = O(\epsilon^2) \to 0$, using $u = O(1)$ and $u' = O(\epsilon)$ in the regular branch.

**The integrated identity.** With the boundary term zero, integrating the right side over the Möbius band and rearranging yields:

$$\int_M |\nabla^2 u|^2\,dA = (\lambda - K)\int_M |\nabla u|^2\,dA$$

**Trace inequality on the Hessian.** The Hessian $\nabla^2 u$ is a symmetric $2\times 2$ tensor with components $u_{ij}$. The trace inequality gives:

$$|\nabla^2 u|^2 = \sum_{i,j} u_{ij}^2 \geq \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_i u_{ii}\right)^2 = \frac{(\text{tr}\,\nabla^2 u)^2}{2} = \frac{(\Delta u)^2}{2}$$

The factor of $1/2$ arises because the trace squares two diagonal terms and the inequality distributes over the off-diagonal terms. Substituting $\Delta u = -\lambda u$:

$$|\nabla^2 u|^2 \geq \frac{\lambda^2 u^2}{2}$$

Integrating over the Möbius band and applying Green's identity with Neumann BC, $\int_M |\nabla u|^2\,dA = \lambda \int_M u^2\,dA$:

$$(\lambda - K)\lambda\int_M u^2\,dA \geq \frac{\lambda^2}{2}\int_M u^2\,dA$$

**The bound.** The anti-periodic sector excludes constants, so $u \not\equiv 0$ and $\lambda > 0$. Dividing by $\lambda \int_M u^2\,dA > 0$:

$$\lambda - K \geq \frac{\lambda}{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \lambda \geq 2K = R_\Sigma = \frac{2}{R^2}$$

This follows Reilly's strategy of integrating the Bochner formula and controlling the boundary term. The cone point is handled by excision: the excision boundary terms vanish in the limit as shown above, and the boundary terms from $\partial M$ vanish because $\kappa_g = 0$. The lower bound holds for any eigenfunction in Sector $\mathcal{A}$, independently of Section 5.

---

## 7. The Identity

Section 5 established the upper bound via direct computation:

$$\lambda_0 \leq \frac{2}{R^2}$$

Section 6 established the lower bound independently via the Bochner identity:

$$\lambda \geq \frac{2}{R^2}$$

for any admissible eigenfunction in Sector $\mathcal{A}$. Together they force:

$$\boxed{\lambda_0 = R_\Sigma = \frac{2}{R^2}}$$

**Equality condition.** Equality in the trace inequality $|\nabla^2 u|^2 \geq (\text{tr}\,\nabla^2 u)^2/n$ in dimension $n = 2$ holds exactly when $\nabla^2 u = (\Delta u/2)\,g$. We verify that $u_0 = \sin(y/R)$ satisfies this on the smooth locus of $ds^2 = dy^2 + \cos^2(y/R)\,dw^2$. With $\Delta u_0 = -2\sin(y/R)/R^2$, the target is $\nabla^2 u_0 = -(\sin(y/R)/R^2)\,g$. The Christoffel symbols for $f = \cos(y/R)$, $f' = -\sin(y/R)/R$ are $\Gamma^y_{yy} = 0$, $\Gamma^y_{ww} = \sin(y/R)\cos(y/R)/R$, $\Gamma^w_{yw} = -\tan(y/R)/R$. The three Hessian components:

$$(\nabla^2 u_0)_{yy} = u_0'' - \Gamma^y_{yy}u_0' = -\frac{\sin(y/R)}{R^2} = \frac{\Delta u_0}{2}\cdot g_{yy} \quad\checkmark$$

$$(\nabla^2 u_0)_{yw} = 0 = \frac{\Delta u_0}{2}\cdot g_{yw} \quad\checkmark$$

$$(\nabla^2 u_0)_{ww} = -\Gamma^y_{ww}u_0' = -\frac{\sin(y/R)\cos^2(y/R)}{R^2} = \frac{\Delta u_0}{2}\cdot g_{ww} \quad\checkmark$$

where the $\partial_w\partial_w u_0$ and $\Gamma^w_{ww}\partial_w u_0$ terms vanish since $u_0$ depends only on $y$ and $\Gamma^w_{ww} = 0$. The bound is sharp and the equality is structural. This is the same Hessian condition that appears in the equality case of the classical Lichnerowicz-Obata/Reilly argument, here verified directly on the smooth locus.

**Simplicity.** In Sector $\mathcal{A}$, the ground eigenvalue is simple: by Sturm-Liouville theory for a limit-circle singular problem with the regular-branch condition at the cone point, the ground state has no interior zeros and is unique up to scaling (Zettl 2005, Ch. 4). The eigenfunction $\sin(y/R)$ is strictly positive on $(0, \pi R)$ and is the unique ground eigenfunction in Sector $\mathcal{A}$.

**Summary.** The flat strip carries $\lambda_0^{\text{flat}} = 1/R^2 = R_\Sigma/2$. The induced metric from the totally geodesic $S^2 \subset S^3$ contributes the additional curvature term $K = 1/R^2$, yielding the exact identity

$$\lambda_0 = \frac{2}{R^2} = R_\Sigma$$

for Sector $\mathcal{A}$.

## 8. Discussion

**Two independent paths.** The identity $\lambda_0 = R_\Sigma = 2/R^2$ is established by two arguments that operate independently. Section 5 constructs the ground eigenfunction explicitly and reads off the eigenvalue directly. Section 6 derives a lower bound from the Bochner identity without reference to any test function. That both paths land at the same value confirms the identity is a geometric property of the embedding, not a coincidence of the computation.

**Relation to the closed case.** For the closed non-orientable surface $\mathbb{RP}^2 = S^2/\{\pm 1\}$, the ground eigenvalue of the twisted Laplacian is also $2/R^2 = R_\Sigma$, recoverable from the odd spherical harmonics at $\ell = 1$. The present result is the open analog: the Möbius band with geodesic boundary in $S^3$ reproduces the same eigenvalue through a different geometric mechanism. On $\mathbb{RP}^2$ the result follows from global spherical harmonic theory on a smooth closed manifold. Here it follows from the totally geodesic embedding supplying curvature to an otherwise flat surface, with the cone point handled by excision and the boundary flux killed by $\kappa_g = 0$.

**The role of the totally geodesic condition.** The flat strip yields $\lambda_0 = 1/R^2 = R_\Sigma/2$. The missing factor of 2 enters through the metric coefficient $f(y) = \cos(y/R)$, which encodes the curvature of the ambient $S^3$. A non-totally geodesic embedding would generally induce a different intrinsic metric and curvature profile, so the spectrum would change through the induced geometry rather than through a separate explicit extrinsic term. The totally geodesic condition isolates the curvature effect cleanly: the induced metric carries constant $K = 1/R^2$ and nothing else.

**The boundary flux vanishing.** The Bochner argument depends on the boundary integral vanishing. The Neumann condition reduces the flux to a term involving the geodesic curvature $\kappa_g$ of $\partial M$ within the surface. Two conditions are operative here and it is worth distinguishing them clearly. The totally geodesic embedding of $\Sigma$ in $S^3$ -- meaning the surface has zero extrinsic curvature in the ambient space, $K_{ij} = 0$ -- establishes the induced metric and curvature $K = 1/R^2$. The geodesic boundary condition -- meaning the boundary curves $w = \pm W$ are geodesics within $\Sigma$, $\kappa_g = 0$ -- is what kills the flux. These are logically independent conditions that both hold here. For the metric $ds^2 = dy^2 + f(y)^2\,dw^2$, the $y$-curves satisfy $\Gamma^y_{yy} = \Gamma^w_{yy} = 0$, hence $\kappa_g = 0$ and the boundary flux is identically zero.

**The cone point.** The metric degenerates at $y = \pi R/2$, the pole of the totally geodesic $S^2$. The Gaussian curvature $K = 1/R^2$ extends continuously to the cone point on the smooth locus. The ground eigenfunction $u_0 = \sin(y/R)$ takes its maximum value 1 at the cone point with $u_0' = 0$. The excision argument in Section 6 shows that the excision boundary terms vanish in the limit, so the Bochner and Green identities remain valid for admissible eigenfunctions despite the metric degeneration.

**Gap in the literature.** Lichnerowicz-type bounds via the Bochner identity have been developed for manifolds with geodesic boundary (Reilly 1977). Kalvoda, Krejčiřík, and Zahradová (2020) study curved Möbius strips in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with non-constant curvature in the thin-strip limit. The present result is narrower: an explicit computation of the ground eigenvalue in Sector $\mathcal{A}$ for a positively curved band with interior cone singularity and geodesic boundary. We are not aware of a prior treatment of this specific model.

## 9. Conclusion

We have established that, in Sector $\mathcal{A}$, the lowest eigenvalue of the twisted Laplace-Beltrami problem on the induced Möbius-band model equals the surface scalar curvature exactly:

$$\lambda_0 = R_\Sigma = \frac{2}{R^2}$$

Two independent paths establish this identity. The upper bound follows from the explicit eigenfunction $u_0 = \sin(y/R)$ with Rayleigh quotient $2/R^2$. The lower bound follows from the Bochner identity, with boundary flux vanishing because the boundary curves are geodesics of the surface ($\kappa_g = 0$) and the cone point handled by excision. The upper and lower bounds coincide: the Hessian of $u_0$ is proportional to the metric at every smooth point, satisfying the equality condition of the trace inequality.

The flat strip carries $\lambda_0^{\text{flat}} = 1/R^2 = R_\Sigma/2$. The induced metric inherited from the totally geodesic $S^2 \subset S^3$ supplies the missing factor of 2 through the constant curvature $K = 1/R^2$. The result is the open analog of the known closed case: the twisted Laplacian on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ also has ground eigenvalue $R_\Sigma$, but through global spherical harmonic theory on a smooth closed manifold. Here the same eigenvalue arises through curvature inheritance and a geodesic boundary condition.

The interior cone point at $y = \pi R/2$, corresponding to the pole of the underlying totally geodesic $S^2$, carries constant curvature $K = 1/R^2$ on the smooth locus. The explicit eigenfunction extends regularly across this point in the admissible class, and the excision-based estimates of Section 6 show that the cone contributes no residual boundary term to the spectral argument.
