# Mode Identity Theory

MIT was a topological thought formed on philosophical grounds before any prediction was computed. Waves were fundamental before any matter was consulted, and nothing was twisted besides Plato after the fact.

Two predictions separate the theory from alternatives: $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$ while $\Lambda$ remains constant. Falsification criteria are pre-registered to Euclid DR1 which will be the only trier of fact.

## The Firing Order

Each step depends on the one before; nothing later exists independently from what came prior.

1. Topology sets what is possible
2. Embedding defines the structure
3. The cosmic wave expresses the boundary
4. Time is phase of the wave
5. Sampling resolves position in the domain
6. Meaning arises only after realization

## Inputs

Three constants fix the physics. Two measurements set the size. One borrowed parameter locates the time.

**Primitives**

| Const. | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| $c$ | 299,792,458 m/s | Propagation rate on the temporal edge $S^1$ |
| $\hbar$ | $1.055 \times 10^{-34}$ J s | Action quantum; converts mode number to energy |
| $G$ | $6.674 \times 10^{-11}$ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² | Curvature-energy dictionary at the Planck floor ($n = 0$) |

**Measured scales**

| Scale | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| $R_\Lambda$ | $\approx 5.3$ Gpc | De Sitter horizon radius; sets the size of the domain |
| $L_\text{fund}$ | $\approx 2.1$ Gpc | CMB low- $\ell$ cutoff; sets the cavity mode. See [cmb-anomalies](../cosmos/cmb-anomalies.md) |

**Concordance parameter**

| Parameter | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| $\Omega_m$ | 0.315 | Matter density fraction; used solely to locate the present epoch ($t_\text{now} = 5.22$ rad) |

**Derived**

| Const. | Definition | Value |
|---|---|---|
| $\ell_P$ | $\sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$ | $1.616 \times 10^{-35}$ m |
| $t_P$ | $\ell_P/c$ | $5.391 \times 10^{-44}$ s |
| $a_P$ | $c/t_P$ | $5.561 \times 10^{51}$ m/s² |
| $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $(R_\Lambda/\ell_P)^2$ | $\approx 10^{122}$ |

## The Topology

$$\Large {S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3, \quad \partial S^3 = \emptyset}$$

A temporal edge bounds a non-orientable surface embedded in a closed space. The space has no boundary. Two uniqueness theorems force the structure: the classification of compact surfaces forces the Möbius strip, and the Poincaré theorem forces $S^3$. There was only one choice.

**[Visualize the Topology](https://dmobius3.github.io/mode-identity-theory/tools/topology.html)**

### Space

$S^3$ is the only simply connected closed 3-manifold (Poincaré). It is diffeomorphic to SU(2) and admits a spin structure. The space has no boundary:

$$\Large {\partial S^3 = \emptyset}$$

The hierarchy terminates here. "What's outside?" is malformed; there is no boundary from which to observe.

### Surface

The Möbius strip is the minimal non-orientable surface with $S^1$ boundary. By the classification of compact surfaces, a connected non-orientable manifold with a single boundary component is formed by removing a disk from the connected sum of $k$ crosscaps. The Möbius strip is the minimal case ($k = 1$), unique by surface classification. Non-orientability is required:

| Requirement | Why non-orientable |
|---|---|
| Anti-periodic BC | $\psi(y + \pi R_\Lambda) = -\psi(y)$; the sign flip requires a surface that reverses orientation |
| Half-integer spectrum | Mode numbers $\nu = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, \ldots$; orientable surfaces produce only integers |
| $\mathbb{Z}_2$ holonomy | The normal direction cannot be globally defined |

Orientable surfaces satisfy none of these. The Möbius strip is the unique surface satisfying all three.

The eigenvalue problem $-\partial_y^2 \psi = \lambda \psi$ under the anti-periodic BC requires $e^{ik\pi R} = -1$, giving $k\pi R = (2m+1)\pi$. The constant mode is forbidden. Matter is fermionic because the surface is non-orientable.

### Temporal Edge

$S^1$ is the boundary of the Möbius surface: a closed loop with geometric circumference $\pi R_\Lambda$. The edge inherits the anti-periodic boundary condition. This is where time advances and where the observer is anchored.

### The Observable Domain

The physical space is $S^3/2I$: the hypersphere modulo the binary icosahedral group $2I$, the largest exceptional discrete subgroup of SU(2), with $|2I| = 120$.

Four auxiliary paths converge on this number (three independent):
1. Group theory of $S^3$ gives $|2I| = 120$ directly
2. The least common multiple of the first five Fibonacci numbers: $\text{lcm}(1,2,3,5,8) = 120$
3. The consonance ratios of musical harmony independently yield $\text{lcm} = 120$
4. The $(2,3,5)$ branch orders of the icosahedron are consecutive Fibonacci numbers satisfying $2+3=5$: the unique Platonic solid whose symmetry orders obey the Fibonacci recurrence

**The 120 domain** is the mode spectrum's resolution. Fermions see all 120 positions but observation squares the wavefunction: $|\psi(\Theta+1)|^2 = |\psi(\Theta)|^2$ erases the anti-periodic sign. The squaring projects $2I \to I$ ($|I| = 60$), halving the resolution.

| Grid | Positions | Minimum step | Observables |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full domain | 120 | $1/120$ | $a_0$ (dynamical) |
| Bosonic projection | 60 | $2/120$ | $H_0$, $\Lambda$, $\alpha$ (photon-mediated) |

**The chronon** is the smallest phase advance the domain can register:

$$\Delta t_{\min} = \frac{4\pi}{120} = \frac{\pi}{30}$$

**The minimum action** $\Delta S_{\min} = \hbar\pi/30$ is absolute: a Lorentz scalar that holds in every frame.

### Confinement

Positive Ricci curvature on $S^3$ means every gauge fluctuation has a minimum eigenvalue. The Weitzenböck identity gives $\lambda \geq 2/R_\Lambda^2 > 0$ for all modes. The mass gap exists and equals $2/R_\Lambda^2$. Confinement is geometric.

### Three Generations

Flat SU(2) connections on $S^3/2I$ are classified by conjugacy classes of homomorphisms from $2I$ into SU(2). Exactly three exist. Each is isolated ($H^1 = 0$): no continuous moduli, no Goldstone bridges between families.

| Vacuum | Mass gap | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trivial | $4/R_\Lambda^2$ | Flat connection | Generation 1 |
| Standard | $4/R_\Lambda^2$ | Irreducible connection | Generation 2 |
| Galois | $36/R_\Lambda^2$ ($9\times$) | Galois conjugate connection | Generation 3 |

Three particle generations from three topological vacua. Full derivation in [Yang-Mills](../spectrum/yang-mills.md).

### The Mass Formula

Four factors, each traced independently to the postulate:

$$\Large m(\rho, \sigma) = \mu_\Lambda \times C_{\text{geom}}(\rho) \times (\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda})^{\,\text{dist}(\rho)/30} \times T^2(\rho \otimes \sigma)$$

| Factor | Role | Source |
|---|---|---|
| $\mu_\Lambda = \rho_\Lambda^{1/4} \approx 2.25$ meV | Vacuum energy floor; overall mass scale | Fourth root of $\Lambda$; ground mode of Möbius surface |
| $C_\text{geom}(\rho)$ | Phase position on the domain | Geometric mean of $C(e/D)$ over Kostant exponents |
| $(\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda})^{\text{dist}/30}$ | Hierarchy; orders of magnitude from vacuum floor | McKay graph distance; $h(E_8) = 30$ as denominator |
| $T^2(\rho \otimes \sigma)$ | Fine structure within each mass shell; generation splitter | Reidemeister torsion; $T^2(R_3)/T^2(R_4) = \varphi^{-4}$ exact |

Applied to 8 nontrivial irreps across 3 vacua, the formula produces 24 mass entries. 12 map to Standard Model fermions; 10 land within a factor of 3; three (electron, up quark, muon) land within 6%. Full derivation in [mass-spectrum](../spectrum/mass-spectrum.md).

### Particle Identity

The icosahedron carries three stabilizer subgroups. Restricting each irrep to these subgroups assigns physical identity.

| Stabilizer | Order | Physical content | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Face ($Z_3$) | 3 | Color: singlet (lepton) vs triplet (quark) | Generation-independent; face geometry identical from all three vacua |
| Edge ($Z_4$) | 4 | Spin-statistics: $D = 120$ (half-int) vs $D = 60$ (int) | Complex vs real $Z_4$ content |
| Vertex ($Z_5$) | 5 | Electroweak interface | Galois conjugate vacua $R_1$, $R_2$ differ in $Z_5$ content |
| Face/Edge | 3/2 | Gravity: Gauss-Codazzi conversion | Surface eigenvalue to space observable |
| Vertex $\times$ twist | $\cos(\pi/10)$ | Weak coupling correction | Dodecahedral defect $\pi/5$, halved by Möbius $\mathbb{Z}_2$ |

The three stabilizer orders are the primes dividing $|2I| = 120$. They generate color, domain, and the electroweak interface. The mass formula computes how heavy. The stabilizer structure says what.

## The Cosmic Standing Wave

Anti-periodicity, the initial-maximum condition ($\Psi(0) = +1$), and ground-state selection ($m_h = 0$) together fix:

$$\Large {\Psi = \cos(t/2)}$$

| Condition | Selects | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Anti-periodic BC | Period $4\pi$ | Two traverses to restore sign |
| $\Psi(0) = +1$ | Cosine over sine | $t = 0$ at amplitude maximum; $\partial_t\Psi\|_{t=0} = 0$ |
| Ground state $m_h = 0$ | No higher harmonics | Isotropy ($10^{-5}$) and orthogonality (Gpc integration) |

The cosmic phase $t = 4\pi\, T/T_\text{cycle}$ where $T$ is cosmic proper time and $T_\text{cycle} \approx 33.2$ Gyr from the Friedmann integral over $L_\text{fund}$.

### The Present Epoch

$$\Large t_\text{now} \approx 5.22 \text{ rad} \qquad \delta \equiv t - 2\pi = -1.06 \text{ rad}$$

| $\Psi$ | Step | $t$ (rad) | Epoch | ~Gyr |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $+1$ | 0 | 0 | Initial | 0 |
| $0$ | 30 | $\pi$ | First crossing | 8.3 |
| $-0.86$ | ~50 | 5.22 | **Present** | **13.8** |
| $-1$ | 60 | $2\pi$ | Turnaround | 16.6 |
| $0$ | 90 | $3\pi$ | Second crossing | 24.9 |
| $+1$ | 120 | $4\pi$ | Completion | 33 |

The bounded topology implies a standing wave, not heat death. The second half of the cycle is the universe settling into resonance. Turnaround at $t = 2\pi$ produces the same observational signature as phantom crossing in fluid-based dark energy models; the corresponding redshift $z_\text{cross} \approx 0.663$ follows from $\delta$. Full derivation in [dark-energy](../cosmos/dark-energy.md).

## Cosmic Scale

### The Scale Hierarchy

$\Omega_\Lambda$ is fixed by $\Lambda$ and epoch-independent. The Hubble scale evolves:

$$\Omega_H(z) \equiv \left(\frac{R_H(z)}{\ell_P}\right)^2, \quad R_H = c/H(z)$$

At the present epoch, $\Omega_H \approx \Omega_\Lambda \approx 10^{122}$. The coincidence is structural: the observer sits near the temporal midpoint of $\Psi$.

### The Observer

The bounded domain spans from $\Omega \sim 10^{122}$ (horizon) to $10^0$ (Planck). The IR $\leftrightarrow$ UV fixed point $x = \Omega/x$ gives:

$$\Large x = \sqrt{\Omega} \approx 10^{61}$$

The geometric midpoint between Planck and cosmic scale. This is where observation resolves.

### Manifold Index

Mode intensity dilutes as $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$. The manifold index $n$ specifies which scale governs the mode being sampled.

| $n$ | Manifold | $\Omega$ | $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ | Observables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Planck floor | 1 | 1 | $G$ |
| 1 | Temporal edge $S^1$ | $\Omega_H$ | $10^{-61}$ | $H_0$, $a_0$ |
| 3/2 | Gauss-Codazzi | — | — | $\Lambda_\text{obs}/\Lambda_\text{top} = 3/2$ (geometric conversion) |
| 2 | Möbius surface | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $10^{-122}$ | $\Lambda$ |
| 3 | Space $S^3$ | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $10^{-183}$ | Null dark matter detection |

#### Why edge uses $\Omega_H$ while surface uses $\Omega_\Lambda$

The temporal edge $S^1$ is where time happens; only the edge can reference a quantity that evolves with cosmic time. The Hubble horizon $R_H(z) = c/H(z)$ evolves; therefore epoch-dependent observables ($H_0$, $a_0$) reference $\Omega_H$. 

The Möbius surface and $S^3$ space are defined by $\Lambda$, which sets the boundary condition itself. Boundary conditions are fixed; therefore epoch-independent observables reference $\Omega_\Lambda$. 

The space ($n = 3$) scaling of $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-3} \sim 10^{-183}$ suppresses any non-gravitational signal to observational null. 

Wrong manifold assignments fail by 61 orders of magnitude.

### Selection Rules

| Observable | Character | $n$ | $\Omega$ | $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\alpha$ | Epoch-independent, dimensionless | $1/30$ | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $\Omega_\Lambda^{-1/60}$ |
| $H_0$, $a_0$ | Epoch-dependent | 1 | $\Omega_H$ | $10^{-61}$ |
| $\Lambda$ | Epoch-independent, geometric | 2 | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $10^{-122}$ |
| Dark matter | Gravity-only | 3 | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $10^{-183}$ |

Dimensionless couplings ($A_P = 1$) bypass manifold dilution; $n$ is fractional.

## The Phase Operator

Different positions on the standing wave carry different observable amplitude:

$$\Large C(\Theta) = 2\sin^2(\pi\Theta)$$

The anti-periodic ground state is $\psi_0(\Theta) = \sin(\pi\Theta)$. Observable intensity is $|\psi|^2$, normalized to unit mean.

| Position | $C(\Theta)$ | Slope $d\ln C/d\Theta$ | Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| $\Theta = 0$ (boundary) | 0 | $\to \infty$ | No observable amplitude |
| $\Theta = 1/2$ (antinode) | 2 | 0 | Maximum amplitude; topologically protected |
| $\Theta = 1$ (boundary) | 0 | $\to -\infty$ | No observable amplitude |

$\Lambda$ sits at the antinode: slope exactly zero. Environmental perturbations leave it unmoved. The cosmological constant is topologically fixed. Full derivation in [cosmological-constant](../cosmos/cosmological-constant.md).

## Fibonacci Wells

Fibonacci positions minimize destructive interference on the 120 domain (Hurwitz: $\varphi$ is hardest to approximate rationally). Below $F_7$, amplitude is indistinguishable from noise. $F_7 = 13$ is the unique well satisfying Fibonacci stability, amplitude above the noise floor, and $\gcd(13, 120) = 1$.

| $F_n$ | Grid | Well | $C(\Theta)$ | Observable | Assignment logic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $F_7$ | 60R | 13/60 | 0.792 | $\alpha$ | Bosonic projection of 13/120; photon-mediated |
| $F_7$ | 120 | 13/120 | 0.223 | $a_0$ | Coprime ($\gcd(13,120)=1$); dynamical, full domain |
| $F_8$ | 120 | 21/120 | 0.55 | Unassigned | — |
| $F_9$ | 120 | 34/120 | 1.208 | $H_0$ | Even numerator; only remaining edge-mode well on bosonic grid |
| $F_{10}$ | 120 | 55/120 | 1.97 | Unassigned | — |
| — | 120 | 60/120 | 2.00 | $\Lambda_\text{top}$ | Antinode; ground-state maximality; slope zero |

$H_0$ and $a_0$ occupy different wells on the same edge; their ratio is fixed by position.

$H_0$ and $\Lambda$ occupy different manifolds; their 61-order span is fixed by dimension.

## The Phase Field

The phase position decomposes as $\Theta = \Theta_0 + \Theta_f$, where $\Theta_0$ is the Fibonacci well (fixed) and $\Theta_f$ is the local environmental shift.

| Environment | $\Theta_f$ | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Global (CMB, BAO) | 0 | Gpc integration erases local structure |
| Inside flat-curve disk galaxy | $2/120$ | One bosonic step; minimum shift the 60-grid can register |

The response is binary: below threshold $\Theta_f = 0$; at or above it $\Theta_f = 2/120$. The coherence scale $L_f = v_c^2/a_0 \approx 13$ kpc for the Milky Way. 

The classification index $\mathcal{T}$ compares the gravitational potential drop across $L_f$ to a critical value $\mathcal{T}_c = 2\xi\, v_c^2/c^2$, where $\xi \approx 0.46$.

**Closure identity.** Both $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}_c$ scale as $v_c^2$; their ratio is galaxy-independent: $\mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}_c = 1/\xi \approx 2.2$. Every flat-curve disk crosses the threshold by the same factor.

| Well | $\Theta$ | Step | Slope $\times$ Step | Shift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $a_0$ | 13/120 | $1/120$ | $17.7 \times 1/120$ | ~15% |
| $H_0$ | 34/120 | $2/120$ | $5.1 \times 2/120$ | 8.4% |
| $\Lambda_\text{top}$ | 60/120 | $2/120$ | $0 \times 2/120$ | 0% |

The 8.4% shift at the $H_0$ well resolves the Hubble tension: $67.4 \times 1.084 \approx 73$ km/s/Mpc. The distance ladder calibration anchor is set inside the Milky Way's phase field; the CMB gives the unshifted value. Full mechanics in [hubble-tension](../cosmos/hubble-tension.md).

## The Scaling Law

$$\Large {\frac{A}{A_P} \approx C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}}$$

$C(\Theta)$ reads the position axis: where the observable sits on the mode spectrum. 

$(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ reads the time axis through $\Omega_H$ for edge modes, or the boundary condition through $\Omega_\Lambda$ for surface modes. The observer at $\sqrt{\Omega}$ is the structural midpoint where both axes resolve to finite values. 

Their product yields $A/A_P$: the modal realization; the ratio of the observable amplitude over its Planck scale reference.

**The sample occurs at** $(t, \Theta)$.

### The Assembled Engine

| Observable | $A_P$ | Grid | $\Theta$ | $C$ | $n$ | $A/A_P$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\alpha$ | 1 | 60R | 13/60 | 0.792 | $1/30$ | $7.33 \times 10^{-3}$ |
| $a_0$ | $a_P$ | 120 | 13/120 | 0.223 | 1 | $2.2 \times 10^{-62}$ |
| $H_0$ | $t_P^{-1}$ | 120 | 34/120 | 1.208 | 1 | $1.2 \times 10^{-61}$ |
| $\Lambda$ | $\ell_P^{-2}$ | 120 | 60/120 | 2.00 | 2 | $2.9 \times 10^{-122}$ * |

> *Includes the 3/2 Gauss-Codazzi conversion from surface eigenvalue $\Lambda_\text{top} = 2/R_\Lambda^2$ to space observable $\Lambda_\text{obs} = 3/R_\Lambda^2$. Gravity in [the-waltz](../spectrum/the-waltz.md).

$\alpha$ occupies the same well as $a_0$ on the 60R-grid; its exponent is fixed by domain resolution. Full derivation in [fine-structure](../spectrum/fine-structure.md).

The $a_0/H_0$ ratio is locked by well positions: $C(13/120)/C(34/120) = 0.184$. Because both are edge modes referencing $\Omega_H(z)$, the ratio holds at every epoch: $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$. Full derivation in [early-galaxies](../cosmos/early-galaxies.md).

## Symbol Glossary

Observables are located in time on the edge and positioned on the mode spectrum. Cosmic phase $t$ sets *when*; phase position $\Theta$ sets *where*.

| Symbol | Name | Domain | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| $t$ | Cosmic phase | $[0, 4\pi]$ | Temporal phase of $\Psi$; $t = 4\pi\, T / T_\text{cycle}$ |
| $\phi$ | Spatial phase | $[0, 4\pi]$ | Cavity mode coordinate; $\phi \equiv 2\pi s / L_\text{fund}$; uniform for $m_h = 0$ |
| $\delta$ | Epoch offset | $-1.06$ rad | Distance from turnaround |
| $\Omega$ | Scale | $(\mathcal{R}/\ell_P)^2$ | Planck areas on horizon; $\mathcal{R}$ is $R_H$ or $R_\Lambda$ per manifold |
| $\Omega_H$ | Hubble scale | $(R_H/\ell_P)^2$ | Evolves with epoch |
| $\Omega_\Lambda$ | De Sitter scale | $(R_\Lambda/\ell_P)^2$ | Fixed by $\Lambda$ |
| $\Theta$ | Phase position | $[0,1]$ on 120 | Observable's position on mode spectrum |
| $\Theta_0$ | Fibonacci well | $\{13, 21, 34, 55, 60\}/120$ | Fixed geometric position |
| $\Theta_f$ | Phase field | 0 or $2/120$ | Local environmental shift |

## Scope

MIT is a topological framework: boundary conditions and permitted mode structure. Boundary conditions are prior to dynamics. Standard dynamics describes the music; MIT defines the instrument.

**What MIT claims.** One postulate, three primitive constants ($c$, $\hbar$, $G$), two measured scales ($R_\Lambda$, $L_\text{fund}$), one borrowed parameter ($\Omega_m$), one scaling law. The Fibonacci wells are fixed positions on the 120-domain, determined by the group structure of $2I$ before any observable is consulted. Every component traces to the topological postulate.

**What MIT leaves intact.** Einstein's field equations and the Standard Model particle content are unchanged. MIT addresses why observables take their values and why gauge fields confine into three generations.

**Parallel work.** Luminet, Weeks, and collaborators proposed $S^3/2I$ as spatial topology, matching CMB low-$\ell$ anomalies. The COMPACT collaboration calculates eigenmodes of non-orientable manifolds, closely overlapping the mathematics MIT requires. Milgrom's MOND established $a_0$ as a fundamental acceleration scale; MIT derives it as an edge mode and predicts $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$.
